# Folder for storing log and trained model.

## Here we provide the pre-trained models for each benchmark datasets: LAPTOP, REST, and TWITTER.

## The performences of those pre-trained models are better than those reported in paper.

### LAPTOP

```
macro-f1: 74.43, test accuracy: 78.25
```

### REST

```
macro-f1: 73.56, test accuracy: 81.13
```

### TWITTER

```
macro-f1: 78.07, test accuracy: 79.19
