battery/n life/n could be better but overall for the price and toshiba ' s reputation for laptops it ' s great !
the extended/0 warranty/0 for the $4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .
the repairs were made quickly though i must say , however the second time they shipped/n it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .
it played various games without problems and ran aero/0 smoothly and flawlessly .
the computer runs/p very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it ( iphoto , imovie , iweb , itunes , garageband ) is all very helpful as well .
it ' s software and speed/p enable it to do amazing things .
returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in ) , buttons not working and usb/n ports/n inoperative .
also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo/p application/p i have ever had
it is super easy to use/p .
the ati graphics card is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel/p built-in/p card/p would have trouble with , such as half-life 2 or even world of warcraft .
  we have had numerous problems with vista/n , such as adobe flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , internet explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update .
the case/0 is carved out of a single block of aluminum .
it is easy to use/p and lightweight .
the amd turin processor seems to always perform so much better than intel/n .
the operating/p system/p and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .
it is easy to use/p , good quality and good price .
disappointing for such a lovely screen/p and at a reasonable price
again in february my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load windows so i contacted acer to get it fixed thru my warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents/n and it seemed as though none of them spoke english .
first the screen/n goes completely out .
and the ram ( the thing that makes it faster ) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance/p to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before .
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard/n .
i love windows 7 but i can ' t give toshiba any credit for that , unless y ' all get serious about ergonomics/n and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time .
now , , , , , my monitor/n has been acting up for about 2 months .
i take it everywhere with me because it ' s so easy to carry/p .
the system constantly overheats , the battery/n life/n is too short , the case is coming apart , and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows 7 on it by using the vmware/0 program/0 .
it has a . 1 ghz faster processor/p and a stock 500gb hard drive .
also , because of the size and consistancy/n of the laptop computer , some websites wouldn ' t even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .
  i was also able to install and use my photoshop and aftereffects/p programs/p easily .
i cannot be happier with the service/p or product .
even though it is running snow leopard , 2 . 4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu/n and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel .
they only stay charged/n a little over an hour .
i was sorly disapointed to discover that hp ( what i thought was a reputable company ) wouldn ' t honor the warrenty/n when the fan blade fell apart .
after replacing the hard/0 drive/0 the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .
they break down just as often as pcs do , and the only reason they don ' t get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they ' re not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus/n protection/n programs/n for/n a/n mac/n , they don ' t exist .
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video/0 games/0 to buy the cd drive .
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor/0 to take it with me when i take photos and video .
only issue is that it is a little slow , and i ' m fixing that by adding more ram/0 .
i had to pay $100 for a universal/n charger/n for this cheap $300 laptop .
it is easy to use , good quality/p and good price .
i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program/p will simply open that file .
we use the built/0 in/0 tools/0 often , itunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iphone .
apparently well-built and gorgeous to look at , the i5 macbook pro is a winning combination of price and performance/p .
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you don ' t carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard/0 .
great laptop for school , easy to use/p for beginners in the household .
i bought this laptop because of the performance to price/p ratio .
boots up fast and runs/p great !
i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality/n control/n during production .
and if you do a lot of writing , editing/n is a problem since there is no forward delete key .
everything is so easy to use/p , mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft software .
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you cannot find the look/p , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .
the material/p this pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any pc specs : like i said this performs a lot better than any computer i ' ve had in the past .
also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto/p that it is the best photo application i have ever had
it really is perfect for work and play/p .
with the upgraded memory , the macbook pro never has an issue running many many applications/0 at once !
it ' s graphics aren ' t bad at all , for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum , easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics/0 .
this just keeps having it ' s hard/n drive/n replaced !
  it gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work/n .
of course , for a student , weight/0 is always an issue .
i connect a lacie 2big external drive via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for time/0 machine/0 .
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard/n !
with a mac computer i have more free time as i don ' t have to wait for windows to boot/n up/n or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows .
then , within 5 months , the charger/n crapped out on me .
stopped booting/n up/n less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .
the 13 " macbook pro just fits in my budget/p and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product .
iphotos is an excellent program/p for storing and organizing photos .
it doesnt work/n worth a damn .
price/p and purpose is awesome !
super fast processor/p and really nice graphics card . .
when i called sony the customer/p service/p was great .
it was very easy to just pick up and use/p it did not take long to get used to the mac os .
its not just slow on the internet/n , its slow in general .
the reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening/n my/n documents/n folder/n .
either the computer is too slow to detect the keys/n typed ( this is unlikely as i am a slow typist ) or the keyboard simply does not detect the keys being typed .
the computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan/n .
  i was told by many that it was a great computer , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty/n was up , then it got really bad .
great product , very easy to use and great graphics/p .
it discharges/n too quickly .
it weighed/0 like seven pounds or something like that .
whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the bios launched windows/n ( or winblows , as i like ot call it ) .
after replacing the hard/0 drive/0 the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .
the 2/p gb/p of/p ram/p is plenty , able to run windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown .
they should have included more memory/n on their computers if they knew vista would run slowly .
the laptop is very lightweight , can easily carry/p around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight .
i ordered through macmall , which saved me the sales/p tax/p i would have incurred buying locally .
the port/0 is secured to motherboard so when this happens you can ' t see the plug at all , it ' s just gone .
second hdd/0 cover/0 has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one .
it has many great programs , such as ilife/p , iphotos and others .
screen is crystal clear and the system/p is very responsive .
my battery/n went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !
upgrading from windows/0 7/0 starter/0 , thru windows 7 home premium , to windows 7 professional was a snap ;
my kids ( and dogs ) destroyed two power/0 cords/0 by pulling on them .
they went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard/0 disk/0 apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .
memory/p is upgradable .
i bought a logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the mbp , but i use the touchpad/p 90% of the time .
only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation apple doesnt provide any kind of word/n processor/n ( such as works for windows ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office .
the computer was shipped to their repair/0 depot/0 on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .
the speed/p gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you sowish .
i work in film editing and post production , so i need a laptop that not only has power , but memory/0 and speed as well .
i have no idea how to burn/0 cd/0 '/0 s/0 or to use the web cam , just for starters .
the system constantly overheats , the battery life is too short , the case is coming apart , and my core/n applications/n that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .
sony parts reliability and quality of service/n is recenlty the worst .
it is very easy to type/p on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted .
graphics/p are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge/0 tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the " repair " .
it is a much more streamlined system/p for adding programs , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .
i sent it back to toshiba twice they covered it under the warranty/p .
asus facial recognition doesn ' t work and windows/n logon/n isn ' t either .
i just took the broken cords/p into the apple store and they gave me new ones .
clear picture/p on it and everything .
i got it back and my built-in/n webcam/n and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .
what i ' d like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory/n .
the battery holds up well , it ' s built/p very solidly , and runs fast .
awesome graphics/p !
  i definitely suggest getting an extended/p warranty/p , you will probably need it !
there are several programs for school or office use ( pages , numbers , keynote/0 , etc . ) , music ( garageband ) , photo management ( photo booth , iphoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( imovie ) , etc .
i had to re-install windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen/n hinges/n .
  and at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory/n stick/n when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( i bought the memory stick they recomended ) .
but , for the cost/p this is a winner .
the brand of itunes/p has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that apple started it all .
externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen/n has a terrible glare .
even so , i like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where i can dualboot windows/p .
garageband is easy to work with , like all the other apple/p applications/p i ' ve had experience with .
just a black screen/n !
the pro is a great product , i wish that the 13 inch models came with the intel/n i/n processors/n and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges hurt my wrists ) .
keyboard is great but primary and secondary control/n buttons/n could be more durable .
also , hdd/p secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .
after a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery/n .
the computer itself was fast , ran/p smoothly , and had no problems .
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5 instead of ddr3/n .
the screen/n gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it ' s very noticeable .
screen , keyboard , and mouse : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch/p mouse/p is worth the extra money to me alone .
also , hdd secures inside using rails/0 , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .
the macbook arrived in a nice twin/p packing/p and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
i dual boot with linux and that other security-prone os and it performs/p flawlessly .
later it held zero charge/n and its replacement worked for less than three months .
you have to toss out the wifi/n card/n and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .
after having two pc laptops die with in the past 3 years , i was led to the apple display at best buy by the sleek design/p and promise of less tech issues .
ever since i bought this laptop , so far i ' ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services i received over the phone with toshiba/n customer/n services/n hotlines .
its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere , but still has a big enough screen/p to get everything done .
it is easy to use , its keyboard/p easily accommodates large hands , and its weight is fantasic .
typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges/n that your wrists rest on .
-when battery/n life/n went to 4 hours or less , took it to the machouse amsterdam for repair ( 26th of august ) .
looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel/n .
  now i had not tried to use this since the disc/n drive/n had been replaced and after taking it back to the geek squad i found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct drive .
wonderful zooming/p .
battery life could be better but overall for the price/p and toshiba ' s reputation for laptops it ' s great !
all the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs/p so much simpler , quicker , and easier .
i also purchased iwork/0 to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to microsoft office ) .
other than that , i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming/p capabilities .
i ' ve haven ' t had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb/0 port/0 wires/0 have all come off .
processor - when compared to my 3 week old early 2011 edition there i barely experience any difference in performance/0 ( 2 . 3 ghz v/s 2 . 4 ghz ) .
the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad/n with a button like my big 16 " laptop does .
there is a backlit/p keyboard/p which is perfect for typing in the dark .
good price/p .
yes , they cost more , but they more than make up for it in speed , construction quality , and longevity/p .
the dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen/p , and many other features .
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports/0 and a dual core amd or intel processor .
  until i bought the dell , i thought you just looked for what you wanted ( size , software/0 , options , hardware ) and purchase the best deal you could find .
it took toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs/n to correct the problem .
i ' m tired of the inept service/n .
  we have had numerous problems with vista , such as adobe flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , internet explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update/n .
  another three weeks later i had my laptop back with a new mousepad , keys/0 , and casing .
if you ' re looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game/0 , you ' d be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .
another thing i might add is the battery/p life/p is excellent .
windows/n is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .
either way , the keyboard/n is unsatisfactory .
again windows/n based machines were not giving me anything to work with !
it had most of the features and all of the power/p that i wanted to replace my desktop machine .
love the graphics , awesome programs/p ( including garageband ) , and really cool default background .
it didn ' t take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation/p - it ' s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .
sure , the initial out of pocket expense/n is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when i factor in all the money in that i wasted on geek squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested pcs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .
that ' s very possible , but since they don ' t make windows xp drivers for the sound card in this machine , i was stuck until windows/p 7/p came out .
  the board has a bad connector with the power/n supply/n and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .
the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price/p .
i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie/n due to his accent .
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it ' s very lightweight , and the response for the computing she ' s doing ( internet focused/0 activity/0 : mail , research , etc . ) is excellent ;
i love the operating system and the preloaded/p software/p .
and that probably explains why i ' ve already had my sata/n controller/n go bad within a year of buying it .
i wish iwork or ms/n office/n came with the mac , but ms office doesn ' t even come with most pc laptops .
the first full charge of this battery/n got me only about 2 full hours .
disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price/p
the toshiba laptop i am using is easier to use/p than most i have tried .
i have been very pleased with the performance/p of this laptop .
the keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard/0 .
i would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life/n span/n i can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine .
i use iphoto/p all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike .
keys/n stick periodically and i havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .
am very glad i bought it , great netbook , low price/p .
though the picture , video , and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software/p im used to ( cs5 ) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers .
in all honesty , if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized/0 laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop , then do not buy this computer .
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality/p .
it ' s so much easier to navigate through the operating/p system/p , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !
for those that care about noise/p this thing doesn ' t really make any ;
once open , the leading/n edge/n is razor sharp .
this computer i used daily nice compact design/p .
stopped booting up less than a week after my one-year/0 warranty/0 was up .
the mac snow leopard o/s is extremely easy to use , although very different than win xp , visa/0 or win7 .
i love this program/p , it is superior to windows movie maker .
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad/0 making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones mic , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .
this is an over-sized , 18-inch/n laptop .
lots of preloaded/p software/p .
i have found also , it is very easy to be able to access wireless/p internet/p access/p ;
so i called compaq , and after being on the phone for 3 hours , i finally got a replacement which i shouldn ' t have had a problem getting since it was under warranty/0 .
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice and firefox , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price/p .
love the stability of the mac/p software/p and operating system .
  then i ' ve fixed the dc jack ( inside the unit ) , rewired the dc jack to the outside of the laptop , replaced the power/0 brick/0 .
this is great if you have several lectures back to back and don ' t have a chance to charge/p during one of the lectures .
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations/0 ( similar to microsoft office ) .
the processor a amd semprom at 2 . 1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing/n .
best buy - 5 stars + + + ( sales , service , respect for old men who aren ' t familiar with the technology ) dell computers - 3 stars dell/p support/p - owes a me a couple
i highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance/p from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door .
  another three weeks later i had my laptop back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing/0 .
we love the size/p of/p the/p screen/p , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .
i preferred the fit and feel of the 13/p inch/p .
the keyboard/p has a wonderful nature feel .
they should have included more memory on their computers if they knew vista/n would run slowly .
not even safe/n mode/n boots .
i have found it very easy to use , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features/p and programs .
3 ) horrible customer/n support/n
when typing/n , letters and spaces are frequently omitted requiring the user to redo many words and sentences .
they offer the best warranty/p in the business , and don ' t 3rd party it out like toshiba .
cords coming out the right for power plus cords/n coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .
there are several programs for school or office use ( pages , numbers , keynote , etc . ) , music ( garageband ) , photo management ( photo booth , iphoto ) , video-editing or movie-making/0 ( imovie ) , etc .
( the ibook/0 backup/0 also uses a firewire connection ) .
i had the staff/n telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " computer .
how does the power/n supply/n not work ! ! !
i think that if it is the motherboard/n again so soon that they should replace it .
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return/n policy/n is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/n mic/n , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .
the dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features/p .
ever since i bought this laptop , so far i ' ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer/n services/n i received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines .
the features/p are great , the only thing it needs is better speakers .
when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty/0 and now it was my problem .
i ' m learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing/p of web pages .
windows/n xp/n sp2/n caused many problems on the computer , so i had to remove it .
the software/p is amazing .
not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a pc and mac , the versions of these programs/p on a mac are graphically and functionally superior .
the i5/n blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .
if you don ' t feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case/p and be happy , plus it looks nice , i bought the white one from best buy .
eventually my battery/n wouldn ' t charge , so unless i had it plugged in it wouldn ' t even power on .
i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance/p .
i wish the volume/n could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month .
i also love the design/p , the looks , the feel , and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull .
the backlit/p keys/p are wonderful when you are working in the dark .
i love the way the entire suite/p of/p software/p works together .
it runs/p perfectly .
not easy to carry/n .
the touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to use buttons/0 to click again !
and the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming/p .
from the build quality to the performance/n , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from apple .
only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor ( such as works for windows ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office/n .
then after 4 or so months the charger/n stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .
( the sata/0 controller/0 is the motherboard chip that lets the cpu talk to the hard drive . )
it is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame/p .
then after 4 or so months the charger/n stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use/p , stylish , fun , awesome computer .
it ' s so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find/p files/p , and it runs a lot faster !
good monitor/p and performed well .
charger/n seems large for this class of computer .
we also use paralles so we can run virtual machines of windows xp professional , windows/0 7/0 home/0 premium/0 , windows server enterprise 2003 , and windows server 2008 enterprise .
if your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers/n , if you want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this computer .
i was sorly disapointed to discover that hp ( what i thought was a reputable company ) wouldn ' t honor the warrenty when the fan/n blade/n fell apart .
dell/n '/n s/n customer/n disservice/n is an insult to it ' s customers who pay good money for shoddy products .
adjust the sensitivity/n since it ' s not that responsive to begin with .
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch/n .
the only thing i didn ' t learn in my research was the software/0 i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .
although its windows vista compared to windows/p xp/p sucks .
the buttons/n you have to press a little harder than most .
this is what i call a good after/p sales/p service/p .
we researched and found the best price/p at macconnection .
all apple/p associates/p are always wiling to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .
it is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user , that makes it run/n way to slow .
can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display/p .
we upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed/p .
on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad/n i would use an external mouse because i didn ' t like the trackpad .
otherwise , all other features/0 are a 1
  this time the mouse pad and right/n click/n key/n wouldn ' t work !
in fact , somehow ( and i never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen/n and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .
good for every/p day/p computing/p and web browsing .
i run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs/0 i do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs .
i run windows via bootcamp/0 for the couple programs i do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs .
i will never go back to windows/n !
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows/p 7/p on it by using the vmware program .
i reloaded with windows/n 7/n ultimate/n , and the bluetooth and fingerprint reader ( software ) would not load .
i ' ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory/n .
i ' m already hooked on the sleek look and dependability/p that this laptop has shown .
it really is perfect for work/p and play .
the touch pad is fine - again , it ' s a real touch/p pad/p .
the games included are very good games/p .
i love my apple , it is quick and easy to use/p .
i run dreamweaver , final cut pro 7 , photoshop/0 , safari , firefox , msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
typing on the keyboard/n becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on .
the newer black/n keyboard/n took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook !
the only thing i can say is that the touch/n pad/n doesnt work like it should all the time .
right size and weight/p for portability .
it is good to know that i can mobilize without having to worry about the battery/p life/p .
if you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a 2gb/p stick/p of/p memory/p to spice it all up a bit more .
it was still working , but there was nothing on the screen/n .
compared to similarly spec ' d pcs , this machine is good value/p , well built and works easily right out of the box .
this computer was so challenging to carry/n and handle .
you will not be able to talk to an american warranty/n service/n is out of country .
there are several programs for school or office use ( pages , numbers , keynote , etc . ) , music ( garageband ) , photo management ( photo booth/0 , iphoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( imovie ) , etc .
the applications/p are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer i have ever owned .
the ilife/p software/p that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .
i love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new toshiba works/p great on both !
oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn ' t come with a recovery/n cd/n so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds .
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something i ' d stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery/0 life/0 five days a week .
i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in/n mic/n were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .
the screen is a little glary , and i hated the clicking/n buttons/n , but i got used to them .
ilife is easily compatible with microsoft/0 office/0 so you can send and receive files from a pc .
keyboard is reasonable size/p .
the programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie/p , etc .
the video card is great for media/p , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .
it rarely works/n and when it does it ' s incredibly slow .
the material this pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any pc specs : like i said this performs/p a lot better than any computer i ' ve had in the past .
the system constantly overheats , the battery life is too short , the case/n is coming apart , and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .
so the fact that the computer does not work/n on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .
the only downfall is the volume/n control/n .
they claim call/n center/n is still down .
the dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory , and a bigger hard/p drive/p than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features .
who couldn ' t love a dvd burner , 80-gigabyte hd , and fairly new graphics chip ? as i soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured sony and toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components/p that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam/0 or full keyboard i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .
the leather/0 carrying/0 case/0 , keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from memphis warehouse .
for the price/p and what i get out of it has exceeded my expectations .
there is no need to open a program/p first and the cliick open or import .
4 ) laptop still did not work/n , blue screen within a week . . .
my power/n supply/n cord/n developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan .
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge/n when it was plugged in ( mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , " 74% , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .
the i3 processor doesn ' t seem to run hot and the fan/p rarely turns on .
great wifi/p too .
yes , i thought the expese/n was a little much , but i now realize you get what you pay for .
either the computer is too slow to detect the keys typed ( this is unlikely as i am a slow typist ) or the keyboard/n simply does not detect the keys being typed .
  it gets stuck all of the time you use/n it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .
after purchasing this thing , i find out that i need a special interface/n device/n to connect my camera , and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line .
i was looking too closely at the other performance/0 specs/0 and while comparing , i took it for granted that these features were standard .
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value/p and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there ' s something to be said about the simplicity of macs .
the processor went on me , the fan/n went and the motherboard went .
you will need them if you want to reload the os/0 ( i recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal ) .
the graphics/n were awful and the warranty isn ' t even worth the cheap payment on the computer .
i will have to purchase spy/0 ware/0 or nortell for privacy protection .
os x is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook/p which save heaps of time .
supplied software : the software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what windows/n comes with .
but when i received my replacement , i made both recovery dvds ( 4 ) , and a driver/application/0 dvd/0 .
the apple/p care/p has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well .
this computer that i have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard/n functions/n .
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb ram/n , the computer was kinda slow .
some features arent friendly ( volume wheel , sound/n quality/n , etc .
the price was very good , and the product is top quality/p .
( beware , their staff/n could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .
i wish iwork/n or ms office came with the mac , but ms office doesn ' t even come with most pc laptops .
it is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus/p protection/p on pc ' s .
great laptop that offers many great features/p !
my only problem is i can not reg . the product/n key/n .
i took it back for an asus and same thing blue screen which required me to remove the battery/0 to reset .
i edit and burn to dvd a lot of video , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive/n .
they sent out a sony/0 '/0 certified/0 ' technician .
also , if you need to talk to a representive/n at/n microsoft/n , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .
get this computer for portability/p and fast processing ! ! !
purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty/n went out .
upgrading from windows 7 starter , thru windows/0 7/0 home/0 premium/0 , to windows 7 professional was a snap ;
i noticed windows has a new system called windows 7 , what about us vista/0 users ?   they should get all the bugs out of vista before investing in a new system .
it didn ' t come with any software/n installed outside of windows media , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .
the processor is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications/0 .
all for such a great price/p .
accordingly , i have decided to never purchase another hp product ( my five year old compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard/n drive/n crashed .
the battery/p life/p is amazing , the versitility is outstanding .
enjoy that toshib force and durability/p unparalleled
  i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the hard drive and mother/n board/n yet again .
keyboard/p good sized and wasy to use .
also you may need to charge/0 it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .
after much effort and 10 days asus replaced itthe wifi/n is very weak .
company provides ups shipping/p , fast , great !
with a mac computer i have more free time as i don ' t have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows/n .
there is no cd/n drive/n on the computer , which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd .
i was loving this netbook because it had an amazing screen/p and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me ( even after installing new browsers ) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime i booted it .
in 5 months the connect/n quality/n got worse and worse .
  i will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty/0 expires and researching carefully when i do so i don ' t run accross a situation like this again !
  i constantly had to send my laptop in for services/n every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .
it works great for general internet/p use/p , microsoft office apps , home bookkeeping , etc .
there are several programs for school or office use ( pages , numbers , keynote , etc . ) , music/0 ( garageband ) , photo management ( photo booth , iphoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( imovie ) , etc .
of course , i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork , garageband/p , and imovie .
i would like to have volume/n buttons/n rather than the adjustment that is on the front .
while apple ' s saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products , and their support/p is great , it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium .
my favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga/p port/p so i can connect it to a bigger screen .
the manufacturer ' s warranty/n only covers replacement/repair of parts .
again , decent comp for the price/p , and i was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .
every driver on the drivers/applications/p dvd/p is everything you will need for a reload .
i had a usb/n connect/n but , i can ' t use it because it is not compatible .
i was originally concerned that i couldn ' t view work i had done in college on my mac because of the pc formatting , but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like ilife and iwork/p that allow you to convert your pc documents into readable files on macs .
despite the inconvenient weight , i opted for the 12/p cell/p battery/p .
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and i ' m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground/0 loop/0 isolator/0 , but i still expected better product quality for this price range .
i thought learning the mac/p os/p would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc .
the internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used , and the command/n prompt/n would not work at all .
it has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics/p .
not to mention it has shit gigs/n .
but , buy this model and just purchase 4gb of ram ( 2x2gb for $92 or 1x4gb for $99 ) , and save yourself $100 than the other model with 8gb/0 of/0 ram/0 .
a longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it ' s spec/p quite easily .
but after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation/n is poor .
summary : hp knew they were shipping out bad bios/n and did nothing proactive to resolve it .
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops , but the ease of use/p , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .
tech/p support/p tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .
learning all of the keyboard/p shortcuts/p only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on windows machines .
it has a faster processor and more ram/p .
  the casing/n of/n the/n power/n cord/n fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket .
the laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the windows/n 7/n starter/n and not the full windows 7 .
while about 8 years ago , i hope that the quality/n has changed .
yes , a mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style/p , speed and just cool factor .
quality display i was surprised with the performance and quality/p of this hp laptop .
the key/n bindings/n take a little getting used to , but have loved the macbook pro .
  toshiba/n customer/n services/n will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and i am not kidding you , i called different hours of the day and you ' ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they don ' t have your history list of your calls right in front of them .
i ' have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes i have had an issue with it one month out of warranty/0 .
i gave it to my daughter because i just hated the screen/n , hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd ' s when i wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork .
my macbook pro works/p like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .
  now i had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the geek squad i found out they had accidently not used the right drive/n when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct drive .
startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , resume/0 from/0 sleep/0 in 0-2 seconds .
it has a 10 hour battery life when you ' re doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ' ll have a battery/p life/p of just over 5 hours .
it was hard to handle and operate/n at school .
this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet/0 .
i had to re-install windows/n within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges .
the ac/n power/n port/n becomes loose over time
i am using the external/p speaker/p sound is good .
returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed ( except for speaker/n grill/n ) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all .
it is much faster than my desktop which is a core2/0 quad/0 running at 2 . 83 ghz .
  sometimes the screen/n even goes black on this computer .
it is well worth the money it cost/p , very good investment .
the 13 " macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price/p we can get for a great product .
everything from the design to the os/p is simple and to the point .
of course , i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork , garageband , and imovie/p .
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance/n of a desktop it does not meet the expectations .
the tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and i have to direct my concern to the " sales " team/n , which is the retail shop which i bought my netbook from .
also , macbooks come with much more features/p which are so cool !
it is easy to use , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and its weight/p is fantasic .
aside from the trial software and the short battery life , lack of a webcam/n , its great .
they improved nothing else such as resolution , appearance/n , cooling system , graphics card , etc .
my one complaint with this laptop is that i ' ve noticed an electronic/n fuzz/n sound/n coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .
i ' m learning the finger options for the mousepad/p that allow for quicker browsing of web pages .
even with virus protection , it always turned off when updates/n were needed and installed .
we carry the netbook around here and there , hence it ' s kinda of irritating when the lcd/n just " slide " downwards .
the best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u can ' t company ' s like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google " dell coupons " you can find codes that take a signifant  amount off the price/p .
compared to similarly spec ' d pcs , this machine is good value , well built and works/p easily right out of the box .
  i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge/n for longer than four minutes .
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing/p the/p web/p and boy o boy does it ever .
keyboard/n could use some trimming .
he has replaced his hard/n drive/n twice and ( of course ) has had to pay for antivirus software every year .
supplied software : the software/p that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what windows comes with .
  also , i have had alot of trouble with the keys/n sticking and will not type correctly .
the people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories/n are less than satisfactory .
unless you need the bluetooth/0 3/0 .
moral of the story : do not buy anything from companies/n that do not respect their customers .
i reinstalled windows/p through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .
the 13 " macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping/p and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product .
there are no gold key numbers too intall programs/n , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .
even though it is running snow leopard , 2 . 4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel/n .
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications/0 .
the mouse/n is way way way to sensitve .
i love this program , it is superior to windows/n movie/n maker/n .
the powerpoint/p opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary .
the ease of set/p up/p was terrific .
right size/p and weight for portability .
the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors/p and resolution .
unable to boot/n up/n this brand new laptop .
it even has a great webcam , and skype/p works very well .
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate/p .
not sure how i recommend it for quality gaming/n , as i have a desktop rig for that reason .
simple to use , and great graphics/p .
it does not keep internet/n signals/n no matter where you bring it .
-4 ram slots , 2 hdd/0 bays/0 , 16gb ram support no wireless issues , at least for me .
my only issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution won ' t increase to a higher resolution/n then 1024 x 60
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it ( iphoto , imovie , iweb , itunes/p , garageband ) is all very helpful as well .
called tech support and got the usual acer " we don ' t support software but for $$$ we can help you " i explained there was no software involved in booting/n .
fan/n noise : the fan made a constant hissing noise in the background .
small enough to use on a long flight , light enough to carry/p through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .
the first one sent : touchpad/n didn ' t work the second sent : usb didn ' t work the third sent : touchpad didn ' t work the fourth sent : hasn ' t arrived yet .
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components/n , and i ' m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but i still expected better product quality for this price range .
i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic/n anytime they went out .
though the picture , video , and music/n software/n is nowhere close to professional grade software im used to ( cs5 ) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers .
well i spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model , which gets hot and the battery/n doesn ' t make it through 1 dvd .
since i ' ve had this computer i ' ve only used the trackpad/p because it is so nice and smooth .
even doing so , the hinge/0 may just be slightly tightened only .
we love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote/p around .
the difference is it ' s a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the apple navigation , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps/p .
the only objection i have is that after you buy it the windows/n 7/n system/n is a starter and charges for the upgrade .
loaded with bloatware/0 .
when i called toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call , even though they didn ' t offer any technical/n support/n .
overall : poor , features : average , performance : poor , battery life : excellent , price/n value/n : poor
suffice it to say , my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed/p .
the little battery/n that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .
reason why ? it ' s because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value/p for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20% , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80% .
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it ' s very lightweight , and the response/p for the computing she ' s doing ( internet focused activity : mail , research , etc . ) is excellent ;
it is everything i ' d hoped it would be from a look/p and/p feel/p standpoint/p , but somehow a bit more sturdy .
it just works/p flawlessly !
i love a " pc " but i was ready for a change and tired of the windows/n system/n .
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it didn ' t work/n .
i also purchased office/0 max/0 '/0 s/0 "/0 max/0 assurance/0 " with the " no lemon " clause .
the screen is framed by half to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk/n .
needs power and mouse cable to plug in back instead of side , in the way of operating a mouse/n in small area .
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense/n you ' ll find that they ' re worth every penny ( besides , there ' s always the financing plan that best buy offers ) .
no temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because " many computers had problems with the nvidia/n chipset/n " inquired status of repair .
the letter/n a/n stopped working after the first week .
i ' ve had to call apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking ( from vancouver ) techs/p that walked me through the processes to help me .
  the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty/n expires the power supply will start having issues .
it has a 10 hour battery/p life/p when you ' re doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ' ll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .
  again i sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan/0 inside .
but if you ' re willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows/0 disc/0 .
though the picture/n , video , and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software im used to ( cs5 ) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers .
-i propose that i can just swap the hard/0 drives/0 .
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam/n breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed ?
when i first got it i thought the size/n of it was a joke .
great pick for portability and affordability/p .
i reloaded with windows 7 ultimate , and the bluetooth/n and fingerprint reader ( software ) would not load .
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard/p and the fit just feels right .
i ' m really impressed with the quality and performance for the price/p of the computer .
then , one month after the warranty/0 expired , the replacement charger went .
the touchpad/p is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again !
the design is awesome , quality/p is unprecedented .
in the shop , these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber/p enclosure/p - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .
battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery/n .
i just plug this into my 22 " monitor and the speedy macosx performs just as well on this dual-core/0 that my dell did with windows 7 with a quad-core .
garageband/0 is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .
if what you need is a machine to do some surfing , email checking , word/0 processing/0 , and watching a movie or two , this is the machine you want .
while most people say that pcs hold functionality/p and value and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there ' s something to be said about the simplicity of macs .
returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keyboard bulging and speaker/n grill/n pressed in ) , buttons not working and usb ports inoperative .
most everything is fine with this machine : speed , capacity/p , build .
iphotos/p is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos .
cords coming out the right for power/n plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .
but the quality/n , in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop .
it didn ' t come with any software installed outside of windows/0 media/0 , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .
  since then i have had minor problems with slow operation/n .
all the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating/p around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery/p is so awesome .
i ' m already hooked on the sleek look/p and dependability that this laptop has shown .
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works/p well and i hooked to my ethernet !
i had of course bought a 3/0 year/0 warranty/0 , so i sent it in to be replaced and ( almost 2 months later ) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement .
there are several programs for school or office use ( pages , numbers , keynote , etc . ) , music ( garageband ) , photo/0 management/0 ( photo booth , iphoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( imovie ) , etc .
but it has a major design/n flaw .
i had static in the output , and i had to reduce the sound/n output/n quality/n to " fm " as opposed to the default " cd .
there are several programs for school or office use ( pages , numbers , keynote , etc . ) , music ( garageband ) , photo management ( photo booth , iphoto/0 ) , video-editing or movie-making ( imovie ) , etc .
the toshiba net book operates/p very well .
so , i took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff ) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot/0 up/0 .
so having the ac/n plug/n go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .
first of all , they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty i ' d paid almost $400 for , and i had to call in , spend hours on their online/n chat/n service/n , and fax in multiple documents .
my laptop cost/n approximately $2 , 300 and died after only 2-years , 10-months and 18-days of use .
waiting for the i7/p was well worth it , great value for the price .
the only thing i don ' t understand is that the resolution/n of/n the/n screen/n isn ' t high enough for some pages , such as yahoo ! mail .
apparently well-built and gorgeous to look at , the i5 macbook pro is a winning combination of price/p and performance .
and the ram ( the thing that makes it faster ) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf/p the/p web/p a whole lot faster than before .
it was a great laptop , ran/p great and was really fast .
but you must get the 15/p inch/p .
the sheer power/p and flexibility makes the macbook pro a must have for any techie !
also , if you need to talk to a representive at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system/n , which most people would have went with xp if they could .
they improved nothing else such as resolution/n , appearance , cooling system , graphics card , etc .
the graphics/p are great .
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari/n and i dont use safari but after i install mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it .
i previously purchased a 13 " macbook ( had pro specs and was aluminum style ) which had a nvidia/0 9800/0 ( if i am not mistaken ) and it had major heating issues .
true quality at a great price/p !
the aspire wont even boot past the acer/n screen/n with a droid ( i have tried both motorola and htc ) plugged into the usb port .
most everything is fine with this machine : speed/p , capacity , build .
it is not ideal for children because of the temp/n .
the headphone and mic/n jack/n are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones mic , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty/p would transfer to the new computer .
i reloaded with windows 7 ultimate , and the bluetooth and fingerprint/n reader/n ( software ) would not load .
pc never worked right even after bios/n fixed .
i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company/n .
apple is always great about the aesthetics/p of things , they always come up with good looking products .
it is very easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature/p that the keyboard is lighted .
-computer crashed frequently and battery/n life/n decreased very quickly .
its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius/p bar/p cannot be beat .
it had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use/0 , and would not move past this error .
that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer/p i got ( that was worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the docking port .
the other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks which can render the browser/n useless .
we paid for the three year warranty and the extended/0 warranty/0 after that one ended as well .
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , " 74% , plugged in , not charging/n " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .
i previously purchased a 13 " macbook ( had pro specs/p and was aluminum style ) which had a nvidia 9800 ( if i am not mistaken ) and it had major heating issues .
the keyboard/p is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops i have had in the past .
the other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks/n which can render the browser useless .
( if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it shouldn ' t , check the " activity monitor " app to see if the disk/0 throughput/0 has temporarily dropped to zero .
it ' s fast , it ' s easy easy easy to set/p up/p , easy to hook to my wireless network .
but there ' s this application called boot/0 camp/0 which allows you to add another os x like windows .
the paint/n wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .
called acer many times , they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair/0 center/0 - i was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer !
this purchase opened me to the world of macbooks , and i am impressed with the intuition of the design , the beauty/p of the product , and the excellent technological advances associated with it .
the internet/p capabilities/p are also very strong and picks up signals very easily .
all the programs/p are easy and straight forward on my macbook pro , it is clean and organized , which i always strive to be myself .
after having two pc laptops die with in the past 3 years , i was led to the apple display at best buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech/p issues/p .
it played various games/0 without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly .
( the sata controller is the motherboard/0 chip/0 that lets the cpu talk to the hard drive . )
it was very easy to just pick up and use it did not take long to get used to the mac os/p .
i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality/p !
i like how the mac os is so simple and easy to use/p .
the touchpad/n is extremely sensitive , which is the only drawback .
for some odd reasons the computer doesn ' t reconize the operation/n system/n .
even though it is running snow leopard , 2 . 4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word/n or excel .
i use my mac all the time , i love the software/p , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you don ' t have to worry about viruses .
pros : the macbook pro notebook has a large battery/p life/p and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .
also the speakers/n are not very loud , but it is a netbook .
first of all , they had no record of me having the 3/n year/n warranty/n i ' d paid almost $400 for , and i had to call in , spend hours on their online chat service , and fax in multiple documents .
the tech guy then said the service/n center/n does not do 1-to-1 exchange and i have to direct my concern to the " sales " team , which is the retail shop which i bought my netbook from .
the machine has a bluray player the book/n has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv .
the black model also has a very nice seamless appearance/p - one of the better looking notebooks i ' ve seen .
i wish the volume could be louder and the mouse/n didnt break after only a month .
i am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite , i like the extra/p features/p , i love the windows 7 home premium .
my real problem with it ? the statement of 7 hour battery/n life/n is not just mere exaggeration -- it ' s a lie .
  this time the mouse/n pad/n and right click key wouldn ' t work !
but with a way bigger screen/p , and is able to connect to an hdmi .
the windows/p 7/p starter/p is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics .
crisp screen , great battery/p life/p , and plenty of storage .
i charge it at night and skip taking the cord/0 with me because of the good battery life .
browsing , also , was no problem for me when i used itunes/p ( which usually slows down my pc ) .
applications/p open in seconds and there are no lags , hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea .
i paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line dvd/p and cd burners .
some features arent friendly ( volume/n wheel/n , sound quality , etc .
see when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating/0 system/0 with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .
the speed difference is next to nothing for a mac , and the hard/0 drive/0 can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb external hard drive .
  it was loaded with windows vista home premium delivered with only 1gb/n of/n ram/n , and it was a *dog* .
keyboard/p is great , very quiet for all the typing that i do .
yes , they cost more , but they more than make up for it in speed , construction/p quality/p , and longevity .
now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power/p and ease of the mac !
  now , as easy as it is to use/p , and i do think it is a great starter laptop .
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i can ' t play it because its not compatable with the software/n .
with a mac you don ' t have to worry about antivirus software or firewall/0 , it ' s so wonderful .
i noticed windows/0 has a new system called windows 7 , what about us vista users ?   they should get all the bugs out of vista before investing in a new system .
  then i ' ve fixed the dc jack ( inside the unit ) , rewired the dc/0 jack/0 to the outside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .
wasted me at least 8 hours of installation/n time/n .
  again i sent it back and they replaced the motherboard/0 and some fan inside .
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat/n sink/n .
had some trouble finding a case/n that it would fit in .
the mac snow leopard o/s is extremely easy to use , although very different than win/0 xp/0 , visa or win7 .
purchased for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing/p , e-mail , etc .
i don ' t have stupid pop up windows ( even when i have pop/0 ups/0 blocked ) , i don ' t have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down .
hard disk - the new editions gives you more hard/p disk/p space/p ( 500gb instead of 320gb ) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk .
of course , i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork/p , garageband , and imovie .
we figure that after everything his pc actually ended up costing/n $350 more than my original mac .
keys/n are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .
but sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding/n the/n bluetooth/n an additional seventy something dollars .
not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs/p .
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen/0 size/0 is not something i ' d stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .
so what if the laptops/mobile phones look/p chic and cool ? the after sales support is terrible .
all of the programs ( keynote , pages/0 , numbers ) have an option to save your documents as microsoft compatible , which really eliminates the need for the actual .
the quality/p , engineering design and warranty are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop .
which is great i am running vista/p business/p and scored a 5 . x on the index i have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 ' s .
mac is not made for gaming/n .
the fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value/p of this machine .
it is so simple to use/p , i use it more than my desktop .
i needed a driver/0 for my hp and they would not help me with out me paying over $50 for it .
i did not have to call the support/0 line/0 at all .
the battery/p life/p is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .
the laptop was very easy to set/p up/p .
pc users use the powerpoint/0 program/0 for slide-show presentation and mac users utilize keynote .
i need graphic/0 power/0 to run my adobe creative apps efficiently .
the track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track/p pad/p , awesome thinking apple !
the best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u can ' t company ' s like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price/p you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google " dell coupons " you can find codes that take a signifant  amount off the price .
first things first , macbook pro has many applications/p to make life easier , unlike the windows computers .
registration/1st use/p is easy .
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ( ie internet tabs , programs/0 , etc ) simultaneously .
  long story short , since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one , i didn ' t ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty/0 for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .
windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online/n service/n .
came fully loaded/p - good .
delivery/p was early too .
the sound/n is a bit quiet if you ' re on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .
i love its solid build/p , light wt and excellent battery life ( for now ) .
you can even run a parallels/p type/p program/p easily and run any leftover pc software that you absolutely cannot be without .
its very nice and once you learn the features/0 you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .
as with any laptop not purchased with software/n options/n , it comes with a lot of what i consider useless applications .
bigger hd , better graphics/p card/p , and a bid hd .
we paid for the three/0 year/0 warranty/0 and the extended warranty after that one ended as well .
tech support tells me the latter problem is a power/n supply/n problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .
didn ' t work/n when shipped from walmart . com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .
i had to call hp and ask for a recovery/n disk/n because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all .
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the warranty/0 .
the games/0 included are very good games .
the next time i had an issue my lightscribe/n wouldn ' t work .
previous laptops were pc ' s , still have them , but the mac/p osx/p is a clean and smooth operating system .
in desparation , i called their customer service number and was told that my warranty had expired ( 2 days old ) and that the priviledge of talking/n to/n a/n technician/n would cost me ( " have your credit card ready " ) .
i ' ve haven ' t had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic/n piece/n that covers the usb port wires have all come off .
the size/p of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming .
i have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and " fixed " the edges/n by rounding them off .
if internet/0 connectivity/0 is important i would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a usb wireless card .
for me , keys/n were starting to get stuck and wouldn ' t type very well .
so what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool ? the after/n sales/n support/n is terrible .
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty/n company/n is horrible .
its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while i am using it for web browsing , uploading photos , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating/p presentations/p .
everything is so easy to use , mac/p software/p is just so much simpler than microsoft software .
-i propose that they can just swap the hard/0 drives/0 .
love the stability/p of the mac software and operating system .
i bought it from hsn because it was " bundled " with extra software , but as it turns out , that software/n just crashes it more often . . . . .
spent 2 hours on phone with hp/0 technical/0 support/0 .
the leather carrying case , keyboard/0 and mouse arrived in two days from memphis warehouse .
the battery/p holds up well , it ' s built very solidly , and runs fast .
so , i paid a visit to lg notebook service center at alexandra road , hoping they can make the hinge/n tighter .
i also got the added bonus of a 30/p " hd monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !
the programs/p are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm .
it is a much more streamlined system for adding programs , using/0 the/0 internet/0 , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .
it has a faster processor/p and more ram .
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web/0 browsing/0 .
this laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch/p screen/p , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
well , i have to say since i bought my mac , i won ' t ever go back to any windows/n .
when you call tech/n support/n you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .
and the screen/p on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming .
can ' t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary/n hardware/n drivers/n .
i ' v spent as much for shipping/n as i would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand .
it seems they could have updated xp/p and done without creating vista .
have not yet needed any customer/p support/p with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion .
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , " 74% , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge/0 .
it was super easy to set/p up/p and is really easy to get used to .
after doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price/p on the 15 " mbp i5 .
it has far exceeded my expectations for power/p , storage , and abilitiy .
seems like maybe a bad shipment/n from toshiba .
the processor/p is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications .
as a user of a pc , i will will admit that the macbook pro has a better running/p system/p in which i found myself " getting the job done quicker .
the large screen/p also helps when you are working in design based programs like adobe creative suite .
i run windows/0 via bootcamp for the couple programs i do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs .
but when i received my replacement , i made both recovery/0 dvds/0 ( 4 ) , and a driver/application dvd .
features such as the dashboard/0 ( allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , computer post its etc .
i love windows/p 7/p which is a vast improvment over vista .
web/n access/n through the 3g network is so slow , it ' s very frustrating and very disappointing .
this computer that i have has had issues with the keyboard/n where it lost half the keyboard functions .
my main reason to convert was the imovie/p program/p .
keyboard/n is plastic and spongey feeling .
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive/n 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard !
the track/p pad/p to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad , awesome thinking apple !
the 17/n inch/n screen/n is very large , but the computer is very light .
 a month later , we reinstall the os/n (/n vista/n ) .
it ' s super fast and a great value for the price/p !
i was loving this netbook because it had an amazing screen and display/p and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me ( even after installing new browsers ) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime i booted it .
i just plug this into my 22 " monitor and the speedy macosx performs just as well on this dual-core that my dell did with windows 7 with a quad-core/0 .
the graphics were awful and the warranty/n isn ' t even worth the cheap payment on the computer .
microsoft/n word/n was not on it andi had to buy it seperately .
  until i bought the dell , i thought you just looked for what you wanted ( size , software , options , hardware/0 ) and purchase the best deal you could find .
the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution/p .
the improvements to the os/p have been relatively gradual , but substantive .
ease of use/p is just one of the benefits i love about my mac .
iphoto/p is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites .
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard/n drive/n and it is putting it temporaly in save zone .
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size/p if i want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser/0 and reopening it it actually works .
lightweight , long battery/p life/p , excellent transition from pc ;
the best thing about this laptop is the price/p along with some of the newer features .
i bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months if it is overload with updates the boot/0 mgr/0 .
it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd/0 memory/0 card/0 reader/0 and an sd memory car expansion .
comfterbale to use light easy to transport/p .
i play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad/p is very responsive .
best thing is i can use existing 32 bit old programs/p .
this computer doesn ' t do that well with certain games/n it can ' t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games .
i bought this laptop and found its tab/n is not functioning .
also , one of the users mentioned how the edges/n on the macbook is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells , it doesn ' t seem to be a problem .
i am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite , i like the extra features , i love the windows/p 7/p home/p premium/p .
the driver/n updates/n don ' t fix the issue , very frustrating .
i love the keyboard/p .
it has good speed/p and plenty of hard drive space .
the store honored their warrenty/p and made the comment that they don ' t even recommend the hp brand because of the problems with their warrentys .
the apple/p applications/p ( ex . iphoto ) are fun , easy , and really cool to use ( unlike the competition ) !
the leather carrying case , keyboard and mouse/0 arrived in two days from memphis warehouse .
great os , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor/p speed/p and adding the thunderbolt port .
this is a great little computer for the price/p .
for the [$] price/p ( special offer ) this is a great laptop .
great os , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt/p port/p .
i agree with the previous comment that asus/n tech/n support/n is horrible which is a con in my opinion .
i recommend for word processing and internet/p users .
the resolution/p is even higher then any other laptop on the market .
there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard/n which is a bummer .
it is easy to use/p , has great screen quality , and every so light weight .
product/n support/n very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
with all the programs that came with it , such as ilife/0 and iwork , i was set from the very beginning .
bigger hd , better graphics card , and a bid hd/p .
the only problems are the sound/n isnt very loud i have to wear headphones .
  the only thing i can imagine is that sony jumped on early specifications for vista/n requirements from microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .
graphics are clean and sharp , internet/p interfaces/p are seamless .
theres also idvd , a program/p dedicated to putting all your favorite media together photos , recordings , video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .
most everything is fine with this machine : speed , capacity , build/p .
with awesome graphics and assuring security/p , it ' s perfect !
  they replaced my hard/0 drive/0 as well as my mother board .
i have vista/n , so i am unable to install and uninstall  some programs .
games/n being the main issue .
again in february my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load windows/0 so i contacted acer to get it fixed thru my warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though none of them spoke english .
the delivery/p was fast , and i would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .
when it come time for warranty/0 service/0 to/0 toshiba/0 you don ' t matter .
good for every day computing and web/p browsing/p .
its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching/p movies/p .
i love its solid build , light wt/p and excellent battery life ( for now ) .
the battery/p life/p seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .
that included the extra sony/0 sonic/0 stage/0 software/0 , the speakers and the subwoofer i got ( that was worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the docking port .
the machine is slow to boot/n up/n and occasionally crashes completely .
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard/p drive/p space/p .
it is sleek and lightweight and charges/p quickly when needed .
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network/n connection/n on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features/p that i was looking for .
i was loving this netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me ( even after installing new browsers/0 ) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime i booted it .
i guess he was the technical/0 person/0 .
the i3/p processor/p doesn ' t seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .
i contacted acer and they are giving me free recovery/p dvds/p , so don ' t go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .
the system/n constantly overheats , the battery life is too short , the case is coming apart , and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .
it ' s also fairly easy to use the operating/p system/p .
the mouse on the pad , the left/n button/n always sticks .
/ awesome cooling/p system/p much better grafics card ( ati 5870 ) / 8gb ram led backlit screen . . .
this purchase opened me to the world of macbooks , and i am impressed with the intuition of the design/p , the beauty of the product , and the excellent technological advances associated with it .
2nd best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches/n to make less easier for people to hack into
the speed/p is incredible and i am more than satisfied .
i have other computers that get strong signals/p that don ' t drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal .
also it comes with very useful applications/p like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
the screen/p graphics/p and clarity , and sharpness are great .
the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop/n icons/n .
then on top of it all their cusromer/n service/n center/n is in the middle east .
only good thing is the graphics/p quality/p .
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications/p ( ie internet tabs , programs , etc ) simultaneously .
after replacing the hard drive the battery/n stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .
you can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover pc software/p that you absolutely cannot be without .
no , tey don ' t even support their own bios/n and it " could be a problem with the bios " how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ? ? ! !
they don t translate from a mac , even on word/n , resulting in a ton of run-on sentences .
good keyboard/p , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows 7 .
i used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old pentium/0 4/0 with ht 1 gb ram sata desktop stopped working ( this was a rock star 7 years ago ) .
the start/n menu/n is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer/p ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !
the graphics are awful and the wireless/n switch/n it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side .
with a mac you don ' t have to worry about antivirus/0 software/0 or firewall , it ' s so wonderful .
this computer is exceptionally thin for it ' s screen/p size/p and processing power .
info : windows failed to load because the kernal/n is missing , or corrupt .
while the keyboard itself is alright , the plate/n around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons .
i just plug this into my 22 " monitor/0 and the speedy macosx performs just as well on this dual-core that my dell did with windows 7 with a quad-core .
the operating system and user/p interface/p is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .
i wanted something that had a new intel/0 core/0 processors/0 and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .
the right/n speaker/n did not work .
screen/p is awesome , battery life is good .
and plenty of storage/p with 250 gb ( though i will upgrade this and the ram . . )
it bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic chrome/n .
design/p : very durable .
they sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when i got my computer back it still wasn ' t running/n right , and now my cd drive wasn ' t reading anything !
the keyboard/p feels good and i type just fine on it .
reason why ? it ' s because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price/p will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20% , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80% .
it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets/0 for my new rolls royce of laptops .
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband/0 to record and edit .
the screen/p is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution .
i already have a hp laptop i bought last year that ' s standard size/0 .
that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer i got ( that was worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended/0 life/0 battery/0 and the docking port .
  after that the said it was under warranty/0 .
long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the depot/0 and that managers don ' t take phone calls or e/mails .
  i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the hard/n drive/n and mother board yet again .
i have found it very easy to use/p , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs .
my wireless/n system/n would not recognize windows 7 and i couldn ' t get online to find out why .
have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed/n , etc .
the battery/n has never worked well .
more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet/n connection/n , or the page can ' t be displayed .
it is easy to use/p , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and its weight is fantasic .
but sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the bios/n again and shut down and would not turn back on .
true quality/p at a great price !
 then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i ' d have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty/n .
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have won ' t work with mac and iwork is not worth the price/n of it .
setting/n would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it ' s own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .
my last computer , a toshiba , cost/p only $400 , and worked like a charm for many years .
when i finally had everything running with all my software/0 installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .
system/n is loosing about 20% of performance because of that .
i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows 7 starter to win 7 home , and it runs/p just fine .
it did not have all the features/n i expected it to have .
  first it burned or fused the power/n adapter/n plug/n .
for the not so good , i got the stock/n screen/n - which is very glossy .
i now realize that my $900 would have been better spent on a windows/p laptop .
even so , i like playing online games/0 , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where i can dualboot windows .
one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting microsoft/n office/n for/n the/n mac/n expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc .
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard and the fit/p just feels right .
runs/p smooth and quick .
the laptop is very lightweight , can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight/p .
ease of use/p is just one of the benefits i love about my mac .
and the ram/p ( the thing that makes it faster ) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before .
then , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement/n charger/n went .
love the graphics/p , awesome programs ( including garageband ) , and really cool default background .
the mousepad/n is a huge pain in the arse !
it had the full sized touch/0 pad/0 with 2 buttons instead of just one .
temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in core/0 processing/0 unit/0 temperatures/0 .
the 13 " macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price/p we can get for a great product .
the os is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a pc , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os/p !
it ' s perfect for everything and runs/p faster than an average pc !
  the machine is slow to boot/n up/n and occasionally crashes completely .
it is very easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard/p is lighted .
setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it ' s own , like the pixel/n sizes/n and whatnot .
startup/0 in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds .
the pro is a great product , i wish that the 13 inch models came with the intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges/n hurt my wrists ) .
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords/n going every direction .
the processor screams , and because of the unique way that apple osx 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware/0 rather than the software .
processor/0 - when compared to my 3 week old early 2011 edition there i barely experience any difference in performance ( 2 . 3 ghz v/s 2 . 4 ghz ) .
the graphics/n are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side .
( i found a 2gb stick for a bit under $50 ) nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system/p to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours , or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents .
it gives me the power/p and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit .
it is easy to use , has great screen/p quality/p , and every so light weight .
the amd/p turin/p processor/p seems to always perform so much better than intel .
the only thing that isn ' t perfect about this netbook is the speakers/n , they are not loud at all but i expected that .
overall : poor , features/0 : average , performance : poor , battery life : excellent , price value : poor
  but i needed a laptop for school/0 use/0 .
great product by apple with the new great looking design/p .
apple/0 care/0 included .
i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program/0 , and the program will simply open that file .
a key contributor that led me to mac is the art/p aspect/p .
but see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software/p that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates .
  even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty/n .
i also got the added bonus of a 30 " hd monitor , which really helps to extend my screen/0 and keep my eyes fresh !
yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explantory in use/p .
the online/p tutorial/p videos/p make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc .
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new arm/p piece/p and they didn ' t even request for a receipt .
additional caveat : the base/n installation/n comes with some toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user ' s liking .
and the multiple/p page/p viewer/p ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .
i don ' t understand why only windows/n 7/n starter/n is included .
with today ' s company fighting over marketshare , its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff/n answering thephone .
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work/n after 2 days .
summary : they played games with me for the warranty/n period/n .
i have vista , so i am unable to install/n and uninstall  some programs .
i ' ve been impressed with the battery/p life/p and the performance for such a small amount of memory .
the display/p on this computer is the best i ' ve seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .
i eventually did the migration from my imac/0 backup/0 disc/0 which uses usb .
anyway , in early july of this year , the dvd burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power/n supply/n .
programs/n would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .
like the price and operation/p .
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5/p instead of ddr3 .
i reinstalled windows through the recovery/p discs/p and everything seemed good again .
i love the dock/p where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .
the screen is bright and the keyboard/p is nice ;
i even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , ichat , photobooth , garage/p band/p and more !
garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone/p , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .
lots of extra space/p but the keyboard is ridiculously small .
a mac is very easy to use/p and it simply makes sense .
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power/n supply/n which you can ' t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small .
fan noise : the fan/n made a constant hissing noise in the background .
i dual boot with linux and that other security-prone/0 os/0 and it performs flawlessly .
the most recent being that my safari/n internet/n browser/n is freaking out on me , but i have just been using firefox instead .
in fact , somehow ( and i never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen/n , in the way of the display .
cords/n coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .
from the build/n quality/n to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from apple .
the bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint/n reader/n driver/n would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .
i love the easy to see screen , and it works/p well for work , persoal or just play .
the unibody/p design/p is edgy and durable .
even though it is running snow/p leopard/p , 2 . 4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel .
that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer i got ( that was worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth/n enabled/n computer , the extended life battery and the docking port .
did i mention everything about it , from size to weight/n to keyboard screams bulk ?
easy to start/p up/p and does not overheat as much as other laptops .
the macbook starts fast , doesn ' t crash , has a fantastic display/p , is small and light ( i have the 13 . 3 " model ) , and isn ' t always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .
i acually believe the issue is with the nvidia/n grafics/n card/n , but still requires a return .
the design/p is awesome , quality is unprecedented .
  the company sent me a whole new cord/p overnight and apologized .
but see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates/p .
runs/p fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better .
overall the computer is very easy to use/p , the screen is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves .
  we have had numerous problems with vista , such as adobe/n flash/n player/n just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , internet explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update .
it had most of the features/p and all of the power that i wanted to replace my desktop machine .
  and at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory/0 for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( i bought the memory stick they recomended ) .
i love the solid machined/p aluminum/p frame/p , and the keyboard is the best of any laptop i ' ve used .
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard/0 i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .
the rep/n did not even answer my question , i had to ask him , if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn ' t even try to acknowledge my question .
the notebook is lacking a hdmi/n port/n and a s-video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv .
i have other computers that get strong signals that don ' t drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal/n .
as a die-hard windows/p enthusiast , i shunned the idea of a mac until this point .
the photobooth is a great program/p , it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera .
  toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended/n warrenty/n is bought toshiba will do nothing about it .
after numerous calls to applecare/n tech/n support/n , i was directed to send in my computer ;
it does not even have the software/n to play a dvd now .
you can find many laptops with the same performance/0 and even better with lower price , but you cannot find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .
this computer is exceptionally thin for it ' s screen size and processing/p power/p .
i never had this kind of quality/n issue with dell ( not to say dell is that great ) , not with a brand new laptop .
although i do believe that windows/n operating/n system/n may be to fault for some of the problems .
externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint/n is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .
tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery/n disk/n .
asked the customer/0 service/0 rep/0 .
i love the easy to see screen/p , and it works well for work , persoal or just play .
the price/p is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .
the screen shows great colors/p .
so what am i supposed to do ? the lg service center cannot provide me the " service " when it is called the " service center/n " .
upgrading from windows 7 starter , thru windows 7 home premium , to windows/0 7/0 professional/0 was a snap ;
screen , keyboard , and mouse : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a mac the beautiful screen/p , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn ' t work/n .
the display/p is incredibly bright , much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp .
  there ' s literally no way to make it sing with vista/n .
the trackpad/p was easy to learn and navigate .
very convenient when you travel and the battery/p life/p is excellent . . .
  i have tried to charge on different batteries/n with no luck .
windows/p 7/p starter/p is terrific ( no you can ' t change the background ) but i don ' t need to , i use it just for school work .
its ease of use/p and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat .
first , it does not have a push/n button/n to open the lid .
this is my second one and the same problem , bad video/n card/n unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy .
the service/n tech/n said he had tried to duplicate the damage and wasn ' t able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .
the first one sent : touchpad didn ' t work the second sent : usb/n didn ' t work the third sent : touchpad didn ' t work the fourth sent : hasn ' t arrived yet .
it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software/0 and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops .
it is very well built/p .
the screen/p shows great colors .
the body/n is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up .
quality/p display/p i love hp , , it ' s the only computer/printer we will buy .
not only are the versions of these programs/p able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a pc and mac , the versions of these programs on a mac are graphically and functionally superior .
i am addicted to photo/p booth/p !
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware/n just to keep this computer running .
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you don ' t carry it around , which could jar the hard/0 drive/0 , or the motherboard .
great battery , speed , display/p .
  the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge/n for more than ten minutes .
every driver/p on the drivers/applications dvd is everything you will need for a reload .
it is absolutely horrible to use/n , despite all its so called advanced features .
after 2 months of complaints , asus finally sent the right power/0 supply/0 to my techies .
  dealing with the support/n drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture .
also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of the incase/p shells/p , it doesn ' t seem to be a problem .
this wiped out several programs/n that were installed on the computer when it was bought .
apparently under the screen/0 there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .
somehow the system/n clock/n got messed up after reboot .
i respond that i do not have the old computer and this way i would lose the data on my hard/n drive/n .
could not keep up with me and finally the hard/n drive/n went out .
i was disappointed when i realized that the keyboard/n doesn ' t light up on this model .
  also the battery/n is completely shot .
as well as having the plug/n in the computer come loose .
i took it in to the apple store and guess what ? they fixed it , no cost/n out of pocket .
the price premium is a little much , but when you start looking at the features/p it is worth the added cash .
one drawback , i wish the keys/n were backlit .
however , i love this particular mac because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic features like the lighted/p keyboard/p and easy mouse pad .
the capabilities using that program/p alone made me want a mac .
i ' m really impressed with the quality and performance/p for the price of the computer .
the screen/p is bright and the keyboard is nice ;
it ' s also very capable of doing moderate video/p editing/p ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing ) .
it has far exceeded my expectations for power , storage/p , and abilitiy .
no luck , although i waited for hours on the phone-visited machouse , they stated the their call/n center/n is down due to too many phonecalls ( difficult to believe ) .
the battery/n life/n is probably an hour at best .
it ' s now all commodity/0 hardware/0 .
but there ' s this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows/0 .
( the sata controller is the motherboard chip that lets the cpu/0 talk to the hard drive . )
i love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the keyboard/p is the best of any laptop i ' ve used .
and if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete/n key/n .
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the external/0 keyboard/0 , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .
it ' s also very capable of doing moderate video editing ( although you may need the performance/n boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing ) .
it ' s applications are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft/p office/p .
it caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard/n drive/n in a matter of hours .
  upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty/0 and i could pay to have it repaired .
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it ( iphoto , imovie , iweb/p , itunes , garageband ) is all very helpful as well .
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use/n .
first , you ll discover that the word processing program known as appleworks/n rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer , if it translates at all .
great os/p , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port .
i can have both osx and windows/p xp/p running at the same time !
have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory/n and speed , etc .
  the hard/n drive/n crashed as well , and i had to buy a new power cord .
not to mention sometimes the whole charger/n unit/n will decide not to work entirely .
the overall build/p quality/p of the unit is excellent and she ' d recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook .
they also have a longer service/p life/p than other computers ( i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks ) .
overall the computer is very easy to use , the screen/p is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves .
the processor/n went on me , the fan went and the motherboard went .
the 13 " macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping/p and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product .
the only thing that i don ' t like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs/n that i want to be able to run and i am not able to .
again in february my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load windows so i contacted acer to get it fixed thru my warrenty/0 and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though none of them spoke english .
a great feature/p is the spotlight search : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .
  this process continued to repeat itself until the mother/n board/n had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have won ' t work with mac and iwork/n is not worth the price of it .
he has replaced his hard drive twice and ( of course ) has had to pay for antivirus/n software/n every year .
i don ' t have stupid pop up windows ( even when i have pop ups blocked ) , i don ' t have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all i can run all the web/p programming/p software/p i need to use all at once without slowing me down .
it was hard to handle/n and operate at school .
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price/p , but you cannot find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .
as with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what i consider useless applications/n .
the aspire wont even boot/n past the acer screen with a droid ( i have tried both motorola and htc ) plugged into the usb port .
10 plus hours of battery/p . . .
needs longer lasting battery/n , more than 1 to 2 hrs .
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance/p , picture quality , and ease of use .
the unibody/p construction/p is solid , sleek and beautiful .
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design/n .
hard/0 disk/0 - the new editions gives you more hard disk space ( 500gb instead of 320gb ) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk .
i love the glass/p touchpad/p .
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs/0 for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to microsoft office ) .
with awesome graphics/p and assuring security , it ' s perfect !
the dvd/n drive/n randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .
i work in film editing and post production , so i need a laptop that not only has power/0 , but memory and speed as well .
 i actually had the hard/n drive/n replaced twice , the mother board once , the dvd drive twice , then they finally agreed to replace it , ( all of this in less than 1 1/2 years !
the ati graphics card is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games/0 that a intel built-in card would have trouble with , such as half-life 2 or even world of warcraft .
in the shop , these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge/n until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .
once i removed all the software/n the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds .
i still have that stupid bluetooth/n mouse/n to !
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture/p quality/p , and ease of use .
it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs/0 i use to edit .
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions/p works great .
many kinds of software/n that is necessary to the working person is not available and cannot be downloaded .
the programs/p that come standard with the leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .
only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor ( such as works for windows ) , but iwork/p is cheap compared to office .
all of the programs/p ( keynote , pages , numbers ) have an option to save your documents as microsoft compatible , which really eliminates the need for the actual .
i couldn ' t believe how long the battery/p lasted on a single charge .
it is fast and i have not had a problem with internet/p connection/p or any other problems .
the programs are esay to use/p and are quick to process this computer works like a charm .
the only thing i wish is the 15 inch macbook pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard/0 .
even out of warranty/0 !
great value/p , fast delivery computer works as if brand new , no problems , very pleased
i especially like the keyboard/p which has chiclet type keys .
also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen/n split in half just from everyday use .
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it ( iphoto , imovie/p , iweb , itunes , garageband ) is all very helpful as well .
it was not clear that the microsoft/n student/n edition/n that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .
the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid ( i have tried both motorola and htc ) plugged into the usb/n port/n .
in november my computer messed up entirely and wouldn ' t power on after intalling a windows update , i had to have my hd/n flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .
awesome laptop and the perfect size/p to carry around in college .
this laptop looks great on the surface : 17/p " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
the quality , engineering/p design/p and warranty are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop .
also , hdd secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard/0 drive/0 .
the tech/n store/n i purchased this from sent it back , , , , , eventually i got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later .
the only downfall is a lot of the software/n i have won ' t work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it .
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries/n possible .
there are several programs for school or office use ( pages , numbers/0 , keynote , etc . ) , music ( garageband ) , photo management ( photo booth , iphoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( imovie ) , etc .
the size/p is perfect and i do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .
the pricing/p is very competitive .
the graphics and screen/p are stunning and although i was a pc person , i was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly .
oh yeah , don ' t forget the expensive shipping/n to and from hp .
after about a week i finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard/0 .
the screen/p is huge and coloful , but no led backlighting .
the screen/n is framed by half to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk .
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to microsoft/0 office/0 ) .
i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam/n and mic anytime they went out .
i paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line dvd and cd/p burners/p .
also kinda loud when the fan/n was running .
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l305d-s5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba/n warranty/n .
however , my girlfriend realized that the netbook ' s hinge/n is a bit loose ( when you open or close the lcd ) .
strong performance in this device makes use/p of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers .
the battery/p is really long .
it ' s so nice to look/p at and the keys are easy to type with .
oh yea , has no numeric/n pad/n on the side .
the fact that the screen/p reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or don ' t want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .
the computer was two weeks late in delivery/n because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork .
i also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse/n pointer/n to jump all over the screen .
if a website ever freezes ( which is rare ) , its really easy to force/p quit/p .
the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate/n due to the stacking .
the photobooth is a great program , it takes very good pictures with the built-in/p camera/p .
i connect a lacie 2big external drive via the firewire/p 800/p interface/p , which is useful for time machine .
great laptop for the price , works well with action/0 pack/0 games/0 .
drivers updated ok but the bios/n update/n froze the system up and the computer shut down .
  the hard drive crashed as well , and i had to buy a new power/n cord/n .
overall , i experienced a huge change in that my mac runs/p pretty fast compared to my old pc .
i connect a lacie/0 2big/0 external/0 drive/0 via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for time machine .
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad/n hard to use when using headphones mic , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped/n .
it works/p fine with our wireless and they ' ve had not problems .
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties ( which cost/n more than the netbook new ) then they are in helping or fixing .
the hinge/n design/n forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .
downfalls : sharp edges/n .
one more tip , please purchase this model and get a 4gb/p stick/p of/p ram/p to save you $10
it is short on space/n , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be ' corrupted ' .
i can ' t say enough of how satisfied i am with their product/p and/p help/p aftermarket/p .
when you look at the specs on apple products in comparison to a dell or a hp , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost/n .
little short on ram/n but you get what you pay for .
i also like the acer/p arcade/p but these were reallythe only two things i liked about this laptop .
i think the manual is somewhere on the hard/0 drive/0 , but i rather have a hard copy .
i looked around and based off my price/0 features/0 comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here .
if you really want a bang-up system/p and don ' t need to run windows applications , go with an apple ;
  we have had numerous problems with vista , such as adobe flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , internet explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same windows/n update/n has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update .
its also fun to use/p !
it is easy to go from one keyboard/0 to another .
i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs/p its amazing .
love that it doesn ' t take up space/p like a regular computer .
asus facial/n recognition/n doesn ' t work and windows logon isn ' t either .
we also use paralles so we can run virtual machines of windows xp professional , windows 7 home premium , windows/0 server/0 enterprise/0 2003/0 , and windows server 2008 enterprise .
was searching online for a power/0 supply/0 when i found this site .
the only thing i wish is the 15 inch macbook pro has much better speakers/n on the side of the keyboard .
there is hardly any memory/n on the computer ' s hard drive .
itunes/p is a handy music-management program , and it is essential for anyone with an ipod .
sometimes you really have to tap the pad/n to get it to worki
the processor went on me , the fan went and the motherboard/n went .
it has easy to use features and all the speed and power/p i could ask for .
the only thing that i have , is the key/n broad/n is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch/p track/p pad/p is amazing .
it was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size/n .
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size/p computer if you ' re restricted to the width of your body for computing room .
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray/n read/write/n drive/n .
called tech support and got the usual acer " we don ' t support software but for $$$ we can help you " i explained there was no software/n involved in booting .
when i got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then i started expeirencing issues again , everything from programs/n and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .
obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the " human interface/0 .
the size is perfect and i do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space/n it gives you .
my laptop now has no battery/n .
the computer itself is a good product but the repair/n depot/n stinks .
you can ' t even get a satellite/n card/n which is why i bought to begin with .
love this laptop wonderful price/p for what you get !
still testing the battery/n life/n as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .
it has a 10 hour battery life when you ' re doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming/0 and movie playing it ' ll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the screen/0 size/0 .
i did think it had a camera/0 because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased .
i dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers/n .
the technical/n service/n for/n dell/n is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .
pc users work in word , while mac users work in pages/0 .
i do transcription work on the side , and the flatline/p keyboard/p makes typing quick and easy as well .
the speed/p is fine .
if this is an improvement in customer/n service/n then i would hate too see what it was before !
features/0 such as the dashboard ( allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , computer post its etc .
was not happy with one/n of/n the/n programs/n on it .
it was truly a great computer costing/p less than one thousand bucks before tax .
the reflectiveness of the display/n is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( i prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .
the store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they don ' t even recommend the hp brand because of the problems with their warrentys/n .
even so , i like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature/p where i can dualboot windows .
this computer was so challenging to carry and handle/n .
it ' s priced/p very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .
i bought a protector/0 for my key pad and it works great : )
because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard/0 and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .
the mouse/0 on/0 the/0 pad/0 , the left button always sticks .
they say that this will invalidate the warranty/n on the hard drive ( i don ' t really understand why but anyway ) .
  now i had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the geek squad i found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct drive/0 .
call tech/0 support/0 , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .
the led/p backlit/p display/p makes my pictures pop so much more .
then the hard/n drive/n failed ;
great battery/p , speed , display .
the port is secured to motherboard/0 so when this happens you can ' t see the plug at all , it ' s just gone .
i like those programs better than office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office/0 programs/0 as well .
i liked the aluminum/p body/p .
now the machine won ' t connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty/n the repair for 30 days and now i ' m out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the netbook .
the laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the windows 7 starter and not the full windows/p 7/p .
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power/n adapter/n , so it ' s not just an isolated incident ! ! !
and it comes with the new osx/p that comes with new features that makes the use more easy .
i ' m having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $176 every 3 months just isn ' t worth it ( that ' s about how long the port/n seems to last ) .
it has come into good use/p for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for gaming .
pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing/p - used to take me forever - now it ' s a snap .
) i also purchased applecare/0 for $300 , which is a three year extended warranty , since i ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .
but there ' s this application/0 called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows .
the fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam/0 underscores the value of this machine .
when i got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then i started expeirencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers/n failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .
i have vista , so i am unable to install and uninstall  some programs/n .
on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad i would use an external/0 mouse/0 because i didn ' t like the trackpad .
took me 11 hours , 3 trips to different fedex offices , and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse it/n support/n technicians/n in the world .
i think the manual/0 is somewhere on the hard drive , but i rather have a hard copy .
compared to similarly spec ' d pcs , this machine is good value , well built/p and works easily right out of the box .
now the screen/n is going darker , darker , darker .
  worse , for the price/n i could get a *netbook* that outperforms this machine .
-4 ram/0 slots/0 , 2 hdd bays , 16gb ram support no wireless issues , at least for me .
the mac takes about the same amount of starting-up/p time/p as the average pc , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .
whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the bios/n launched windows ( or winblows , as i like ot call it ) .
its office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs/0 .
pay attention to the specs/0 if you want these options .
support/n has been lackluster and now i just want a refund .
the difference in the apple keyboard from a pc/0 '/0 s/0 keyboard/0 took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it ' s worth it !
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand/0 however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .
it is fast booting up , shutting/p down/p , and connection with the internet .
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon/n 5850/n would have ddr5 instead of ddr3 .
love the graphics , awesome programs ( including garageband/p ) , and really cool default background .
love the speed/p , especially !
your cursor/n will end up all over the freaking place , , , it ' s not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad .
the big screen/p allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !
the keyboard/p is top notch .
i love its solid build , light wt and excellent battery/p life/p ( for now ) .
( i had been a windows linux user before this ) i love the size/p because the screen is big enough for what i use it for ( internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .
runs hot i thought we were paying for quality/n in our decision to buy an apple product .
i upgraded the memory/0 and replaced the base windows 7 starter to win 7 home , and it runs just fine .
it has far exceeded my expectations for power , storage , and abilitiy/p .
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall/0 charger/0 cause the battery is so awesome .
however , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you ' re gaming/0 ) .
it has a 10 hour battery life when you ' re doing web browsing and word/0 editing/0 , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ' ll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .
only other thing is that if you are using this for document/0 creation/0 apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor ( such as works for windows ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office .
apparently well-built and gorgeous to look/p at , the i5 macbook pro is a winning combination of price and performance .
i had my iworks , itunes/p , email , ms office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .
it has plenty of memory , lots of hard/p drive/p , and great graphics .
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the applecare/p warranty/p plan/p .
it took toshiba/n tech/n support/n 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem .
and having to deal with the company/n has been a even worse nightmare .
they say it could be the motherboard/n again , but dell
great laptop for the price/p , works well with action pack games .
  only a few days after i received the computer back , the screen/n froze again .
love the graphics , awesome programs ( including garageband ) , and really cool default/p background/p .
screen , keyboard/0 , and mouse : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .
it is always reliable , never bugged and responds/p well .
i wish it had a webcam/n though , then it would be perfect !
the keyboard/0 is like no other laptop keyboard .
i charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery/p life/p .
i am most impressed with the programming/p , including the iphoto .
i purchased a toshiba satellite m60 ( with harman/kardon speakers/p ! ) in december of 2005 .
cosmetically , the only thing they changed was 2 of the function/0 keys/0 at the top .
its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone/p assistance/p or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat .
there also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows/n loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .
it works great for general internet use , microsoft/p office/p apps/p , home bookkeeping , etc .
you won ' t have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus/n program/n that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .
hmmm - that high failure rate sure isn ' t reflected in the retail/n price/n .
it might be something deep within windows , for i was unable to create a disk/n image/n on my hard drive .
i would like to use a different operating/0 system/0 altogether .
it is loaded with programs/n that is of no good for the average user , that makes it run way to slow .
: - ) if you buy this - don ' t go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery/n life/n , and you ' ll be perfectly satisfied .
this laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance/p , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
however , my girlfriend realized that the netbook ' s hinge is a bit loose ( when you open or close the lcd/0 ) .
the ati/p graphics/p card/p is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel built-in card would have trouble with , such as half-life 2 or even world of warcraft .
it has 3 usb/0 ports/0 , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .
because he said that the hinge/n is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .
plain and simple , it ( laptop ) runs/p great and loads fast .
but the arm/n velcro/n is torn after one use .
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed/n .
either the computer is too slow to detect the keys typed ( this is unlikely as i am a slow typist ) or the keyboard simply does not detect the keys/n being typed .
the acer one computer that i bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but i like the big screen/p on it .
first , you ll discover that the word/n processing/n program/n known as appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer , if it translates at all .
not to mention , the battery/p life/p is absolutely amazing .
i ' m really impressed with the quality/p and performance for the price of the computer .
with the upgraded/p memory/p , the macbook pro never has an issue running many many applications at once !
again , the same problem , the right/n speaker/n did not work .
strong performance/p in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers .
i especially like the backlit/p keyboard/p .
i think part of the problem with this computer is vista , yet i know vista isn ' t the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it also has vista/n ( i should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ) .
after a little more than a year of owning my macbook pro , the monitor/n has completely died .
the programs that come standard with the leopard/0 running/0 system/0 are enough for the average person to run all the basics .
that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the speakers/p and the subwoofer i got ( that was worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the docking port .
there is hardly any memory on the computer ' s hard/n drive/n .
i spoke with a service/0 rep/0 at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it ' s not just an isolated incident ! ! !
this is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing/p power/p and long battery life .
it is light and the battery/p last a very long time .
the screen graphics and clarity/p , and sharpness are great .
the internet/n explorer/n was very slow from the very beginning .
the only down fall is that it has no cd/n drive/n but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .
i ' ve had to call apple/p support/p to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking ( from vancouver ) techs that walked me through the processes to help me .
i chose the ibookg4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen/p big enough to please anyone .
additional caveat : the base installation comes with some toshiba-specific software/n that may or may not be to a user ' s liking .
peformance is good for the price/p .
the processor is very quick and effective as i load/p webpages/0 and applications .
the screen graphics and clarity , and sharpness/p are great .
fan/p vents to the side , so no cooling pad needed , great feature !
the battery/n life/n was shorter than expected .
it weighed like seven/0 pounds/0 or something like that .
i dislike the weight/n and size , cubersome .
it has a lot of memory and a great battery/p life/p .
they say sorry out of warranty/n .
i think part of the problem with this computer is vista , yet i know vista isn ' t the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it also has vista ( i should have waited the few months to get the next operating/0 system/0 ) .
since i keyboard over 100 wpm , i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard ( no keys sticking or lagging , strange configuration/p of/p "/p extra/p key/p " , etc .
was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard/n problems .
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system/n crashed .
the processor/n a amd semprom at 2 . 1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing .
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and i ' m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but i still expected better product quality/n for this price range .
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it ( iphoto , imovie , iweb , itunes , garageband/p ) is all very helpful as well .
i ' ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget/p and the features i need .
it ' s color/p is even cool .
  after the warrenty/0 expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace .
the os/p is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly .
battery/n is not upgradable to a longer life battery .
at first , the computer seemed a great deal--seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price/p .
also consider the ms/n office/n apps/n are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .
the tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and i have to direct my concern to the "/n sales/n " team , which is the retail shop which i bought my netbook from .
whenever i call dell about an unrelated problem , they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if i ' d like to purchase more memory/0 for $75 .
quality display i was surprised with the performance/p and quality of this hp laptop .
i had 3 months when the ports/n started going out .
it has plenty of memory/p , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .
the dv4 boasted a faster processor/p , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features .
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry/p when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .
-called headquarters again , they report that tft/n panel/n is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week ( week 3 ) .
it works/p really well .
i am most impressed with the programming , including the iphoto/p .
i just plug this into my 22 " monitor and the speedy macosx performs just as well on this dual-core that my dell did with windows/p 7/p with a quad-core .
i am forever changed and will no longer buy a windows/n based machine for personal use .
i love the size/p of the computer since i play games on it .
but to be honest , i don ' t use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming/0 .
reason why ? it ' s because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value/p will only drop 10-20% , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80% .
2 months later , the battery/n went .
this is my first dell i heard their customer/n service/n was lacking and that they were working on improving it !
they say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard/0 drive/0 ( i don ' t really understand why but anyway ) .
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory/p and hard drive space .
fan vents to the side , so no cooling pad needed , great feature/p !
my daughter uses it for games/0 , email , facebook , pictures and music .
i had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan/n noise/n cause it is a " different " computer .
the programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail/p ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .
-4 ram slots , 2 hdd bays , 16gb ram support no wireless/p issues , at least for me .
we upgraded the memory/0 to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .
i mainly use it for email , internet/0 , and managing personal files ( pics , vids , etc . ) .
your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , , it ' s not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad/n .
  the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power/n supply/n will start having issues .
screen/p is crystal clear and the system is very responsive .
i believe that the quality/p of a mac is worth the price .
the so called laptop runs/n to slow and i hate it !
enabling the battery/n timer/n is useless .
the screen/p is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard and the fit just feels right .
with all the programs that came with it , such as ilife and iwork/0 , i was set from the very beginning .
so , i took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff ) fixed it by resetting the fan/0 at boot up .
the only bad part is the size/n weight/n .
the biggest problem is that the box had no instructions/n in it .
three , the mac book has advantages over pcs ' with linux/n based/n os/n there is very ' few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac .
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair/0 depot/0 .
1 . you can not change your desktop background ( window ' s 7 starter does not support that function/n ) .
but to be honest , i don ' t use my computer for anything like graphics/0 editing/0 and complex data analysis and gaming .
the computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my pc did , and i have all of the programs/p that were on my pc .
the dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web/p cam/p , nicer screen , and many other features .
i even got my teenage son one , because of the features/p that it offers , like , ichat , photobooth , garage band and more !
since i keyboard over 100 wpm , i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard/p ( no keys sticking or lagging , strange configuration of " extra key " , etc .
in desparation , i called their customer service number and was told that my warranty/n had expired ( 2 days old ) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me ( " have your credit card ready " ) .
hard disk - the new editions gives you more hard disk space ( 500gb instead of 320gb ) but time has taught me never to trust an internal/0 hard/0 disk/0 .
next , most acer laptop fans/0 are on the bottom which is right on your laptop .
maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen/n has simply gone black .
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working/n out of no were .
in due course , i ' ll remove the hard/n disc/n from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .
i had in the past a dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair/p technician/p to my house to fix it .
it ' s applications/p are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft office .
  it is easy to use/p , fast and has great graphics for the money .
with what i do know how to do , the computer works/p beautiful .
there is no number pad/n to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer .
in fact , somehow ( and i never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display/n .
os/p x/p is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .
did i mention everything about it , from size to weight to keyboard/n screams bulk ?
1 . you can not change your desktop/n background/n ( window ' s 7 starter does not support that function ) .
) and printing from either word/n processor/n is an adventure .
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice and firefox/0 , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .
has a 5-6 hour battery/0 life/0 .
my only issues are : 1 ) the screen/video/n resolution/n won ' t increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
comes with imovie/p ;
( no problem with the ordering or shipping/p by the way .
also , the space/n bar/n makes a noisy click every time you use it .
can ' t reinstall with standard/n os/n cd/n because of proprietary hardware drivers .
the price/p is great for this model , i only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room .
previous laptops were pc ' s , still have them , but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating/p system/p .
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications/0 on this one before i purchased .
no , tey don ' t even support their own bios and it " could be a problem with the bios/n " how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ? ? ! !
waiting for the i7 was well worth it , great value for the price/p .
it is a real touchpad/p , not the toy i saw in other brands .
sure it has the one/p touch/p keys/p but that was the best feature of the computer .
the battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the battery/0 with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2 . 5 to 3 hours .
i couldn ' t believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge/p .
i thought the price/p was great for the specs .
it took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that i owned the warranty/n .
i made a photo book as a gift , on my computer , pushed " buy " and it drew from my itunes/0 account and sent the book to my house , the book was of perfect quality-exactly how i had created it and looked better than i had even imagined .
before , i reloaded with windows/0 7/0 ultimate/0 and used only the downloaded drivers from acer ' s site .
it ' s so bad that i ' m thinking i only got half a battery/n or something .
i ' m still within the one year warranty/n but the repair " depot " has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .
first things first , macbook pro has many applications to make life easier , unlike the windows/n computers .
but to be honest , i don ' t use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex/0 data/0 analysis/0 and gaming .
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery/p life/p lasts all day for her , it ' s very lightweight , and the response for the computing she ' s doing ( internet focused activity : mail , research , etc . ) is excellent ;
overall i feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance/n , although it did have great battery life when it did work .
i run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs i do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad/0 programs/0 .
with the switch/n being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .
images/p are crisp and clean .
but guess what ? ( you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn ' t have a built in type ) the notebook can ' t be used because it doesn ' t read anything for an external/n drive/n .
i would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop , and the battery/p life/p is amazing .
-4 ram slots , 2 hdd bays , 16gb/0 ram/0 support/0 no wireless issues , at least for me .
  the battery never held a charge/n longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
crisp screen , great battery life , and plenty of storage/p .
  i would rather spend my money on a computer that costs/n more then a toshiba that isn ' t good at all .
info : windows/n failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .
battery is lasting about 6 hours as i am surfing/0 the/0 web/0 on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos .
i always use a backup hard/0 disk/0 to store important files at all times .
i love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad/p .
the battery/n life/n was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2 . 5 to 3 hours .
one drawback i noticed was sound/n quality/n via/n usb/n .
navigation/p through the computer is far superior compared to windows operating systems , as well .
everything about the mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use/p .
who couldn ' t love a dvd/p burner/p , 80-gigabyte hd , and fairly new graphics chip ? as i soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured sony and toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
i also love the design , the looks , the feel , and the my/p toshiba/p feature/p is wonderfull .
screen , keyboard , and mouse/0 : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .
its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while i am using it for web browsing , uploading photos , watching/p movies/p ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations .
they went through asking me open up various components , taking battery/0 out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .
all the things you can do with the trackpad/p make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .
great laptop for the price , works/p well with action pack games .
while the keyboard/p itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons .
this is a review of windows/0 vista/0 system/0 .
  we have had numerous problems with vista , such as adobe flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , internet/n explore/n just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update .
another great thing is the beast/p graphics/p .
overall i feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery/p life/p when it did work .
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds/p .
i needed one to be able to carry/0 to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria .
for the same price/n , you get a lot more in the asus . . . . 1920x1080 res .
  another three weeks later i had my laptop back with a new mousepad/0 , keys , and casing .
with windows laptops a wireless/0 mouse/0 is an absolute must .
now the machine won ' t connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection/0 card/0 in may but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now i ' m out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the netbook .
my macbook is so much better looking/p and so thin !
macbook notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery/n life/n , as well as the many background programs that run without the user ' s knowlede .
  i considered i may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space/p and that is not the issue .
the processor screams , and because of the unique way that apple osx 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software/0 .
i noticed windows has a new system called windows 7 , what about us vista users ?   they should get all the bugs out of vista/n before investing in a new system .
it ' s like 9/n punds/n , but if you can look past it , it ' s great !
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot/p .
the difference in the apple/0 keyboard/0 from a pc ' s keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it ' s worth it !
with all the programs/0 that came with it , such as ilife and iwork , i was set from the very beginning .
there are several programs for school or office use ( pages , numbers , keynote , etc . ) , music ( garageband ) , photo management ( photo booth , iphoto ) , video-editing/0 or movie-making ( imovie ) , etc .
anyway , in early july of this year , the dvd/n burner/n stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .
i love the multi-touch/p trackpad/p .
i even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , ichat , photobooth/p , garage band and more !
however , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking/p area/p make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you ' re gaming ) .
the touch/p pad/p is among the best .
the speakers/n on it are useless too .
, applications/p respond immediately ( not like the tired ms applications ) .
the speed/n difference is next to nothing for a mac , and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb external hard drive .
however , i love this particular mac because its very fast , great size/p , and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad .
with the upgraded memory , the macbook pro never has an issue running/p many many applications at once !
a seventy dollar mouse/0 !
i personally like the gaming/p look/p but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
also , if you need to talk to a representive at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp/p if they could .
keyboard good sized and wasy to use/p .
its office compatible , but the features and its functioning/0 is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .
another included/n program/n that is laughable is the chess game .
unfortunately , apple ' s quality/n has continued to slide .
theres also idvd , a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together photos , recordings , video projects into one program/p so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .
it ' s still beautiful and has better color/p reproduction/p than i could ever expect from a notebook .
the flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os/n x/n .
laptop was in new condition and operational , but for the audio/n problem when 1st sent for repair .
i loaded windows/p 7/p via bootcamp and it works flawlessly !
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look/p at , i think there ' s something to be said about the simplicity of macs .
  the board has a bad connector/n with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .
i dual boot with linux/0 and that other security-prone os and it performs flawlessly .
so , i took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius/n bar/n staff/n ) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up .
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb/p ports/p .
it seemed to be a very nice laptop except i was not able to load my garmin gps software or microsoft/n office/n 2003/n .
a cheaper price/p should not equal a " cheap " product .
the mac/p version/p of/p microsoft/p office/p is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .
right size and weight for portability/p .
the layout/n of the macbook is horrible and confusing ;
the best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u can ' t company ' s like dell who allow you to choose the components/p are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google " dell coupons " you can find codes that take a signifant  amount off the price .
battery/n life/n needs more life .
besides the great look/p , it is a great machine .
i find myself using the 10-key/p more than i thought i would .
i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows/0 7/0 starter/0 to win 7 home , and it runs just fine .
after paying several hundred dollars for this service/n , it is frustrating that you cannot get help after hours .
setting would change for some reason , the screen/n size/n would change on it ' s own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .
from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation/n ;
its a good laptop for its value/p .
first , it does not have a push button to open the lid/0 .
they are by far the easiest systems/p to actually learn about computers with .
in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a new issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " senior tech/n " .
they sent out a sony ' certified ' technician/0 .
the feature/p are good enough for what i need .
quality/p display/p i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop .
i wish iwork or ms office came with the mac , but ms/n office/n doesn ' t even come with most pc laptops .
i would like at least a 4 hr . battery/0 life/0 .
i would tell the technician/n i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in .
the sheer power and flexibility/p makes the macbook pro a must have for any techie !
i ' ve owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse/n button/n has broke .
the screen/n takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the laptop .
the computer runs/n extremely slowly , whether opening word or my computer .
i bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse/n stopped responding .
 i actually had the hard drive replaced twice , the mother/n board/n once , the dvd drive twice , then they finally agreed to replace it , ( all of this in less than 1 1/2 years !
the built-in/p webcam/p is great for skype and similar video-chat services .
however , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external/0 mouse/0 unnecessary ( unless you ' re gaming ) .
this laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots/p up/p quickly , runs fast etc .
easy to carry/p , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .
as usual at customer/n service/n center/n , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .
the battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were sol there to , so much for that warranty/n covering all the products we purchased .
the 13 " macbook pro just fits in my budget/p and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product .
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i ' m always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability/p and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .
the magnetic/p plug-in/p power/p charging/p power/p cord/p is great ( i even put it to the test by accident ) - excellent innovation !
enjoy that toshib force/p and durability unparalleled
microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows/n problems .
the only problem is a lack of screen/n resolutions/n !
itunes is a handy music-management program/p , and it is essential for anyone with an ipod .
theres a built/p in/p camera/p with special effects for video and photography .
so , after apple replaced the hard/0 drive/0 i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning--completely .
the screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard/p is very easy to use , very important for use quick typers .
  the screen/n almost looked like a barcode when it froze .
even though it is running snow leopard , 2 . 4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office/n mac/n applications/n such as word or excel .
i love windows 7 which is a vast improvment over vista/n .
i can barely use any usb/n devices/n because they will not stay connected properly .
yeah , of course smarty pants " fix it now " ) software - compared to the early 2011 edition i did see inbuilt/n applications/n crashing and it prompted me to send the report to apple ( which i promptly did ) .
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i ' m always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery/p life/p ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .
acer has set me up with free recovery/p discs/p , when they are available since i asked .
i ' ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance/p for such a small amount of memory .
on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad i would use an external mouse because i didn ' t like the trackpad/n .
laptops are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery/n ?
so , the hard/0 disk/0 capacity/0 really doesn ' t matter to me .
lots of extra space but the keyboard/n is ridiculously small .
a great computer for light home/p use/p and business use .
a second problem involves the battery which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service/n .
maximum/n sound/n isn ' t nearly as loud as it should be .
finally , i should note that i took the 2gb/0 ram/0 stick/0 from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time .
none of the techs/n at/n hp/n knew what they were doing .
that ' s very possible , but since they don ' t make windows xp drivers for the sound/n card/n in this machine , i was stuck until windows 7 came out .
the display/p is awesome .
it is of high quality , has a killer gui , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications/p , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .
i love windows/p 7/p but i can ' t give toshiba any credit for that , unless y ' all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time .
but there ' s this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os/0 x/0 like windows .
if internet connectivity is important i would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a usb/0 wireless/0 card/0 .
as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity/p , and ease of use of this computer make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;
i have found it very easy to use , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs/p .
and it comes with the new osx that comes with new features that makes the use/p more easy .
the gray/p color/p was a good choice .
while i mostly use it for email , internet and gaming/0 , i ' m confident all other applications live up to the high standard i ' ve come to appreciate from mac laptops .
comfterbale to use/p light easy to transport .
and if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed/p .
my favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so i can connect it to a bigger screen/0 .
the 2 gb of ram is plenty , able to run windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs/p with next to no slowdown .
the first full/n charge/n of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .
they are about the same size keys/0 .
this computer will last you at least 7 years , thats an amazing life/p spanned an electronic .
i was a little weary at purchasing another 13 " macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics/p cards/p in order this time around .
( i had been a windows/0 linux/0 user before this ) i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for ( internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .
typically , when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external/0 mouse/0 for convenience .
and the warranty/p on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .
i eventually did the migration from my imac backup disc which uses usb/0 .
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales/p associate/p , i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook .
this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look/p .
like the price/p and operation .
sound/n card/n is limited though .
also , i issued a replacement rma for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen/n , which is noticable to me .
the battery/n doesn ' t last long but i ' m sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem .
i called their repair/0 depot/0 as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot .
web access through the 3g/n network/n is so slow , it ' s very frustrating and very disappointing .
the battery/p life/p is great .
but the screen/p size/p is not that bad for email and web browsing .
i used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old pentium 4 with ht 1/0 gb/0 ram/0 sata desktop stopped working ( this was a rock star 7 years ago ) .
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn ' t require a dedicated video/0 card/0 .
it has a 10 hour battery life when you ' re doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie/0 playing/0 it ' ll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size/p and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .
it didn ' t take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs/p and navigation - it ' s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .
the os takes some getting used to especially after being a windows/0 user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !
it has good speed and plenty of hard/p drive/p space/p .
its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while i am using it for web browsing , uploading/p photos/p , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations .
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops , but the ease of use , security/p , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions/p works great .
startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown/0 in 2-4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds .
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets/0 , and presentations ( similar to microsoft office ) .
this laptop is a great price/p and has a sleek look .
aside from the trial software and the short battery/n life/n , lack of a webcam , its great .
they gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery/n itself , it didn ' t die .
the only thing i would change about it is the mouse/n keys/n .
i can render avchd movies with little effort , which was a problem for most pc ' s unless you had a quad/p core/p i7/p .
it made the computer much easier to use/p and navigate .
the processor screams , and because of the unique way that apple osx/p 16/p functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software .
only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor ( such as works for windows/0 ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office .
all in all , a very disappointing experience except that i learned how good the geek squad is and also customer/p service/p .
in desparation , i called their customer/0 service/0 number/0 and was told that my warranty had expired ( 2 days old ) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me ( " have your credit card ready " ) .
plain and simple , it ( laptop ) runs great and loads/p fast .
i had my iworks , itunes , email , ms/p office/p , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .
but with a way bigger screen , and is able to connect to an hdmi/0 .
the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard/p and it ' s speed .
i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , i took it for granted that these features/0 were standard .
obviously one of the most important features/0 of any computer is the " human interface .
newegg ' s rma/p service/p was great as always , i contacted them late friday night , and they issued me an rma number and a prepaid ups shipping label the very next morning on saturday .
the battery/n gets so hot it is scary .
speaking of the browser/n , it too has problems .
i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows 7 starter to win/0 7/0 home/0 , and it runs just fine .
they sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when i got my computer back it still wasn ' t running right , and now my cd/n drive/n wasn ' t reading anything !
the screen/0 brightness/0 automatically adjusts .
i like how the mac/p os/p is so simple and easy to use .
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system/n memory/n and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5 instead of ddr3 .
the acer one computer that i bought is 17/0 ince/0 screen/0 and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but i like the big screen on it .
  the battery/n is irreplaceable .
it has many great programs , such as ilife , iphotos/p and others .
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install mozzilla/p firfox/p i love every single bit about it .
the program/p came with the computer and works beautifully .
the mac snow leopard o/s is extremely easy to use , although very different than win xp , visa or win7/0 .
the display on this computer is the best i ' ve seen in a very long time , the battery/p life/p is very long and very convienent .
windows/n vista/n makes this computer almost unusable for online service .
the quality , engineering design and warranty/p are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop .
while it was highly rated , would i like it ? i tried the keyboard/0 at the store , and it seemed ok .
i like those programs better than office/n and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office programs as well .
the mouse/n pad/n and buttons are the worst i ' ve ever seen .
but guess what ? ( you have to buy an external/n dvd/n drive/n it doesn ' t have a built in type ) the notebook can ' t be used because it doesn ' t read anything for an external drive .
it is very easy for anyone to use/p an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook .
great pick for portability/p and affordability .
the built/p in/p camera/p is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus .
also the keyboard/n does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .
the system/n it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .
i saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what i know now , i would not buy it at that price/n .
it is of high quality , has a killer gui , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use/p , and is absolutely gorgeous .
i love windows 7 but i can ' t give toshiba any credit for that , unless y ' all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections/n less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time .
it ' s software/p and speed enable it to do amazing things .
the only thing is that the battery/n won ' t last more than 1/2 an hour .
the material this pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any pc specs/n : like i said this performs a lot better than any computer i ' ve had in the past .
although its windows/n vista/n compared to windows xp sucks .
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup/n with cords going every direction .
if what you need is a machine to do some surfing/0 , email checking , word processing , and watching a movie or two , this is the machine you want .
 one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day i turn it on , no gui/n , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari/n but after i install mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it .
the screen/p resolution/p was exactly what i was looking for .
i also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen/0 .
i ' ve also had to have the keyboard/n replaced at my expense .
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there ' s something to be said about the simplicity/p of macs .
pc users use the powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and mac users utilize keynote/0 .
when we bought our new hp comouter in dec . of 2008 , we wanted windows xp , but were told it would cost an extra $159 , so we went with vista/0 .
it is short on space , and downloads/n always had problems being completed , or were said to be ' corrupted ' .
( i had been a windows linux user before this ) i love the size because the screen/p is big enough for what i use it for ( internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .
garageband/p is easy to work with , like all the other apple applications i ' ve had experience with .
i thought the price was great for the specs/p .
it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection/0 is weak or not .
took several hours with customer/n support/n before i could even start the pc out of the box .
my husband uses it mostly for games/0 , email and music .
i love the operating/p system/p and the preloaded software .
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price/p for what i need it .
it ' s a great product for a great price/p !
overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design/p and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .
i also had a problem with the touchpad/n that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen .
i love the size of the computer since i play games/0 on it .
very good quality/p and well made .
i am constantly trying to uninstall programs/0 , clean cookies , and delete unused files .
/ awesome cooling system much better grafics/p card/p ( ati 5870 ) / 8gb ram led backlit screen . . .
drivers updated ok but the bios update froze the system/n up and the computer shut down .
i wouldn ' t play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run ms/0 office/0 , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , i ' d highly recommend checking this out .
the mouse/n buttons/n are hard to push .
drivers/p updated ok but the bios update froze the system up and the computer shut down .
the battery/n never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
great product , very easy to use/p and great graphics .
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price/n of a new one ) .
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer/n will not even move .
in addition , all the design tools on pages and keynotes/p makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .
the programs/p are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .
simple to use/p , and great graphics .
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell/0 for privacy protection .
the bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software/n would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .
good keyboard , long battery/p life/p , largest hard drive and windows 7 .
this laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point/p , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
but to be honest , the compatibility/n issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll buy a pc next time .
it was slow , locked up , and also had hardware/n replaced after only 2 months !
if you really want a bang-up system and don ' t need to run windows/0 applications/0 , go with an apple ;
i paid for extra memory and the 17-inch/0 screen/0 , as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners .
this laptop looked brand new and was shipped/p very quickly .
ilife/p is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from a pc .
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old word/p processer/p which works good .
or the cursor/n would show up some place else .
some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software/n , but there is no guarentee .
the speed difference is next to nothing for a mac , and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb/0 external/0 hard/0 drive/0 .
i think part of the problem with this computer is vista/n , yet i know vista isn ' t the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it also has vista ( i should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ) .
in addition , there is photo/p detection/p software/p that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture .
he loves it and it is easy to use/p and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .
its white color/p is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .
the macbook is also made better , my computer has never got a virus , and the laptop runs/p just as fast as the first day i bought it .
the computer continued to give me issues and in late june it completely died again and i tried to call acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty/n was up and hung up on me .
i run dreamweaver , final/0 cut/0 pro/0 7/0 , photoshop , safari , firefox , msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
who couldn ' t love a dvd burner , 80-gigabyte hd/p , and fairly new graphics chip ? as i soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured sony and toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
the paint wears off easily due to the keyboard/n being farther back than usual .
the mac/p snow/p leopard/p o/s/p is extremely easy to use , although very different than win xp , visa or win7 .
this is a nicely sized/p laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life .
externally the keys on my keyboard/n are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices/0 of laptops .
speakers/n doesn ' t sound that great .
it ' s graphics/p aren ' t bad at all , for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum , easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics .
that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer i got ( that was worth the money ) , the bluetooth/0 mouse/0 for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the docking port .
it seems they could have updated xp and done without creating vista/n .
i hope to edit this in the next few hours , i am going to try to install my own copy of windows/0 7/0 .
the macbook arrived in a nice twin/p packing/p and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
theres also idvd/p , a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together photos , recordings , video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .
the graphics/p on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid .
) i also purchased applecare for $300 , which is a three year extended/0 warranty/0 , since i ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .
i could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory/n left .
we use the built in tools often , itunes/p is open nearly every day and works great with my iphone .
the resolution/p on/p the/p screen/p is almost pure hd .
i have not had a problem with the applications/p quitting or freezing .
the headphone/n and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones mic , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .
this laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs/p fast etc .
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers/p and the subwoofer .
it ' s just as fast with one program/0 open as it is with sixteen open .
so i called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance/0 at all , i just chose to hide the message .
features like the font/n are very block-like and old school .
excellent speed/p for processing data .
strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed/p this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers .
i had to adjust my mousepad/n sensitivity/n , because it is very sensitive .
i also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom/n of/n the/n computer/n would get really hot .
its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while i am using it for web/p browsing/p , uploading photos , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations .
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design/n of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .
the fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or don ' t want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen/p .
laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing/n looks like that of a 17 " .
in the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive/n failed which had to be replaced .
you have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network/n capability/n .
good monitor and performed/p well .
i run dreamweaver , final cut pro 7 , photoshop , safari , firefox/0 , msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
that system/0 is fixed .
also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable , easy to use/p computer .
i even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , ichat/p , photobooth , garage band and more !
  the board/n has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .
for the bluetooth/0 to work properly , you must install the launch manager on the drivers/applications dvd , or it will not show after the reload .
overall : poor , features : average , performance : poor , battery/p life/p : excellent , price value : poor
also , the extended/n warranty/n was a problem .
the os/p is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a pc , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os !
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use/p the mac offers .
i paid for extra memory/0 and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners .
overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors/p to choose from .
i noticed windows has a new system called windows/0 7/0 , what about us vista users ?   they should get all the bugs out of vista before investing in a new system .
before , i reloaded with windows 7 ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers/0 from acer ' s site .
very fast boot/p up/p and shut down .
going to bring it to service/0 today .
even though it is running snow leopard , 2 . 4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning/n wheel/n would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel .
the neat and organized icon/p list/p is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons .
the tech/0 guy/0 then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and i have to direct my concern to the " sales " team , which is the retail shop which i bought my netbook from .
the machine has a bluray/0 player/0 the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv .
three , the mac book has advantages over pcs ' with linux based os there is very ' few problems with system/n performance/n when it comes to a mac .
the performance/p is awesome .
i just plug this into my 22 " monitor and the speedy macosx/p performs just as well on this dual-core that my dell did with windows 7 with a quad-core .
it ' s so much easier to navigate/p through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !
three weeks after i bought the netbook , the screen/n quit working .
another issue i have with it is the battery/n .
the internet/p speed/p is spectacular .
i was originally concerned that i couldn ' t view work i had done in college on my mac because of the pc formatting , but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like ilife/p and iwork that allow you to convert your pc documents into readable files on macs .
but the machine is awesome and ilife/p is great and i love snow leopard x .
i bought a protector for my key/p pad/p and it works great : )
i have never really been big on downloading anything so i wasn ' t too worried about getting a virus , plus i thought i was protected by norton/n .
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse/0 , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .
however , i love this particular mac because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse/p pad/p .
i mainly use it for email , internet , and managing/0 personal/0 files/0 ( pics , vids , etc . ) .
the minute you fire it up it ' s all good , very easy user/p interface/p .
if you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win/p 7/p and grab a 2gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .
once again , i was told it was the suspicious power/n supply/n problem .
thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the screen/n will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what i mean .
it ' s wonderful for computer gaming/p .
i had to pay for the shipping/n !
i ' ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features/p i need .
then it ceased charging/n at all .
still under warrenty/n so called toshiba , no help at all .
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software/0 - you guys were great too !
the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but i have just been using firefox/p instead .
great value , fast delivery/p computer works as if brand new , no problems , very pleased
the ilife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use/p and produces a great finished product .
i gave it to my daughter because i just hated the screen , hated that it had no cd/n drive/n to at least play cd ' s when i wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork .
sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run/p like none other on the planet , and when i factor in all the money in that i wasted on geek squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested pcs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .
they said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty , and that products with  extended/0 warranties/0 are taken care of through third parties and not sony itself anymore .
the large screen/p gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your computer instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room .
however , the multi-touch/p gestures/p and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you ' re gaming ) .
it is easy to use , good quality and good price/p .
the service/p i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty .
i just plug this into my 22/0 " monitor and the speedy macosx performs just as well on this dual-core that my dell did with windows 7 with a quad-core .
the graphics/p are stunning .
i was said it ' s videocard/n .
the battery/n life/n also doesn ' t keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
summary : i ' ve had this laptop for 2 months , out of the blue the power/n adapter/n stops working .
i am enjoying it and the quality/p it provides is great !
but , buy this model and just purchase 4gb/0 of/0 ram/0 ( 2x2gb for $92 or 1x4gb for $99 ) , and save yourself $100 than the other model with 8gb of ram .
tried to make a recovey/n disk/n wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk .
yes , a mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed/p and just cool factor .
i have had another mac , but it got slow due to an older operating/n system/n .
a great computer for light home use and business/p use/p .
my problem was with dell/n customer/n service/n .
it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd/0 memory/0 car/0 expansion/0 .
it is easy to navigate and update/0 programs/0 .
returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in ) , buttons/n not working and usb ports inoperative .
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended/0 warranty/0 .
i believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price/p .
it has all the features/p that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .
 one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day i turn it on , no gui , screen all dark , power/0 light/0 steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .
  this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard/n drive/n replaced 3 times .
it is of high quality/p , has a killer gui , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .
you can call hp and they want you to buy more software/0 to fix it .
there are several programs/0 for school or office use ( pages , numbers , keynote , etc . ) , music ( garageband ) , photo management ( photo booth , iphoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( imovie ) , etc .
the price/n premium/n is a little much , but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash .
the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it ' s speed/p .
it has a . 1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb/p hard/p drive/p .
i also liked the glass/p screen/p .
all i will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality/p than my hunk of crap vaio .
i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty/n expired .
i had it four months when my disc/n drive/n refused to open .
very long-life battery/p ( up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings ) .
the first problem is that the keyboard/n function/n is simply unsatisfactory .
the large screen also helps when you are working in design/0 based/0 programs/0 like adobe creative suite .
we also use paralles/0 so we can run virtual machines of windows xp professional , windows 7 home premium , windows server enterprise 2003 , and windows server 2008 enterprise .
there are several programs for school/0 or/0 office/0 use/0 ( pages , numbers , keynote , etc . ) , music ( garageband ) , photo management ( photo booth , iphoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( imovie ) , etc .
at first it worked well for a month or so then the system/n board/n failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again .
it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory/p to satisfy my needs .
its office/p compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .
the screen is framed by half to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen/n size/n and increases the bulk .
now for the hardware/n problems .
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd/0 drive/0 .
everything about a mac is wonderful , it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system/0 , but you will learn fast and its all worth it .
computer has been at service/n facility/n more than in my hands .
with a mac computer i have more free time as i don ' t have to wait for windows to boot up or shut/n down/n and all the viruses associated with windows .
the feel/p of this is better than the toshiba , too .
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad/p .
yes , they cost more , but they more than make up for it in speed/p , construction quality , and longevity .
keyboard/p was also very nice and had a solid feel .
" this isn ' t a big deal , i haven ' t noticed the issue with dvds or other media , only through usb/n output/n .
although the price/n is higher then dell laptops , the macbooks are worth the dough .
temperatures/0 on the outside were alright but i did not track in core processing unit temperatures .
the first programm/0 i switched on was a game for my children .
no tutorials/n on the display .
the processor/p screams , and because of the unique way that apple osx 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software .
i had read online that some users were having sound/n problems .
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard/p which most laptops do not have .
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware/n just to keep this computer running .
love the stability of the mac software and operating/p system/p .
( if you ever see the spinning/n beachball/n come up when you think it shouldn ' t , check the " activity monitor " app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero .
the image/p is great , and the soud is excelent .
the battery doesn ' t last long but i ' m sure an upgrade battery/p would solve that problem .
it ' s fast , it ' s easy easy easy to set up , easy to hook/p to/p my/p wireless/p network/p .
as a lifelong windows/n user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac .
i also did not like the loud noises/n it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot .
the battery never held a charge/n longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
it ' s fast and has excellent battery/p life/p .
after 20-30 min the screen/n of the notebook switched off .
i like those programs/p better than office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office programs as well .
it is extremely portable and easily connects/p to/p wifi/p at the library and elsewhere .
vista/n is a nightmare .
 one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day i turn it on , no gui , screen/n all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .
then just the other day , my left/n "/n mouse/n " button snapped !
the nortons/n virus/n scan/n is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .
you know , using the computer should be fun , not aggrevation , especially when you are playing/0 games/0 or working with photos .
i get a ton of compliments on its size/p , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you ' re restricted to the width of your body for computing room .
then hp sends it back to me with the hardware/n screwed up , not able to connect .
i run dreamweaver , final cut pro 7 , photoshop , safari/0 , firefox , msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
of course , i inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges/n are tighter and i even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others .
the screen/n is a little glary , and i hated the clicking buttons , but i got used to them .
  i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty/n expired .
screen/0 , keyboard , and mouse : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .
other installed features , such as certain printer/p software/p , are also most attractive .
it is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features/n .
i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty/n .
i recommend for word/p processing/p and internet users .
however , i may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping/0 carton/0 .
fast , great visual/p !
  also , i have had alot of trouble with the shift/n key/n to go to other lines .
laptop is advertised as a 15/0 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .
  also , the battery/n does not last very long at all .
it ' s super fast and a great value/p for the price !
can ' t close the 2nd hdd/n bay/n since there are brackets you have to break off ( even then , it still doesn ' t shut ) that could be a major flaw for the dual hdd user .
despite the claims of the apple apologists ( a vice of which i am recently myself reformed ) the internals/n of mac laptops are no different from pcs ' at this point .
  however the frozen screens/n kept happening .
the switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming/0 on the laptop .
the computer loads/p in about a 1/10th of the time that my pc did , and i have all of the programs that were on my pc .
the os is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run/p flawlessly .
power/n supply/n went bad after 2 weeks --
mac also has many apps/p and programs that are quite cheap or free .
the image is great , and the soud/p is excelent .
the brand/n is tarnished in my heart .
) i also tried the touch/0 pad/0 and compared it to other netbooks in the store .
it might be something deep within windows/n , for i was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive .
bigger hd/p , better graphics card , and a bid hd .
a great feature is the spotlight/p search/p : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .
the macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance/p .
in addition , all the design tools on pages/p and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .
strengths : well-shaped weaknesses : a bad videocard/n !
screen , keyboard , and mouse : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a mac the beautiful screen , responsive island/p backlit/p keyboard/p , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .
wonderful features/p .
the large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like adobe/0 creative/0 suite/0 .
it fires/p up/p in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing .
apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen/0 gets moved back and forth , they come loose .
i had my iworks/p , itunes , email , ms office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .
the video card is great for media , and above average for gaming/p , but not a gamers first choice .
after sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , i broke down and spent another $100 to get microsoft/0 word/0 for/0 mac/0 .
i am not much of a computer techie , so i can understand some of the internal problems , though i do have trend micro as an antiviral/0 program/0 .
the macbook starts/p fast , doesn ' t crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light ( i have the 13 . 3 " model ) , and isn ' t always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .
crisp screen/p , great battery life , and plenty of storage .
i feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic/n pieces would/n come off of it .
it ' s priced very reasonable and works/p very well right out of the box .
getting the apple/p care/p plan/p is a must .
lightweight and the screen/p is beautiful !
now mainboard/n is broken , have to wait for a new one .
it has a lot of memory/p and a great battery life .
as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability/p , longevity , and ease of use of this computer make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;
the battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery/n would only last me on average about 2 . 5 to 3 hours .
i also love the small , convenient size/p of my laptop , making it a perfect tool for my academic studies .
  i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech/n support/n and had to result the their online chat .
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage/p .
other than that its a great performing/p machine and well meets all my needs and more .
of course , i also have several great software/p packages/p that came for free including iwork , garageband , and imovie .
i should have checked this before i installed my applications/0 .
they also use two totally different operating/0 systems/0 .
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet/p !
also the display/p is exceptional !
runs fast and the regular/p layout/p keyboard/p is so much better .
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment/n or something but idk .
take your time and go through the tutorials/0 patiently .
another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed/0 $175 to send it in to fix it .
  the lcd/n screen/n stopped working on mine after 10 months .
i love the size , keyboard , the functions/p .
they improved nothing else such as resolution , appearance , cooling system , graphics/n card/n , etc .
the programs are great , like iphoto/p ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .
/ awesome cooling system much better grafics card ( ati 5870 ) / 8gb/p ram/p led/p backlit/p screen/p . . .
there are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a windows/n computer .
the dvd/n burner/n broke after burning 3 dvd ' d during that time !
i also love the design , the looks , the feel/p , and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull .
we also use paralles so we can run virtual machines of windows xp professional , windows 7 home premium , windows server enterprise 2003 , and windows/0 server/0 2008/0 enterprise/0 .
it also came with a built/p it/p web/p cam/p which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home .
granted , it ' s still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my mac boots/p up/p noticeably quicker .
you may need to special order a bag/0 .
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup/n so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .
i also love the design , the looks/p , the feel , and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull .
10 hours of battery/p life/p is really something else . . . .
hp is more interested in selling extended/n warranties/n ( which cost more than the netbook new ) then they are in helping or fixing .
it ' s so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs/p a lot faster !
it is a much more streamlined system for adding programs/0 , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and i ' m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but i still expected better product quality for this price/n range/n .
really like the textured surface/p which shows no fingerprints .
the battery/n life/n sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were sol there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .
treat yourself to a more expensive , long-lasting laptop of quality/p like a sony , apple , or toshiba .
and looks very sexyy : d really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price/n .
i had upgraded my old macbook to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but hadn ' t been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch/p features/p .
in may i started having problems with the usb/n ports/n not working .
after replacing the hard drive the battery/n stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .
i went to toshiba/p online/p help/p and found some suggestions to fix it .
tons of bloatware and junk programs/n .
i got my macbook pro because i wanted to do all the stuff i need to do without worrying about the system/0 quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes .
  they replaced my hard drive as well as my mother/0 board/0 .
i also got the added bonus of a 30 " hd/p monitor/p , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !
my computer froze on several occasion , had buttons/n that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all .
it didn ' t come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price/p , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .
that ' s very possible , but since they don ' t make windows/n xp/n drivers/n for the sound card in this machine , i was stuck until windows 7 came out .
apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal/n paste/n .
the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge/n for more than ten minutes .
even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard/n larger .
i ' m still within the one year warranty but the repair/n "/n depot/n " has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .
since i keyboard over 100 wpm , i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard ( no keys/p sticking or lagging , strange configuration of " extra key " , etc .
there are so many wonderful features/p and benefits to the new macbook !
the video/n chat/n is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better .
externally the keys/n on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .
  the battery/n never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
i work in film editing and post production , so i need a laptop that not only has power , but memory and speed/0 as well .
suffice it to say , my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery/p life/p and blazing speed .
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer/p .
wireless/p has not been a issue for me , like some others have meantioned .
battery/0 is lasting about 6 hours as i am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos .
the cover for the dvd drive soon came off , too--a mark of poor construction/n quality/n .
many of my classmates computers hard/n drives/n crashed .
after about a week i finally got it back and was told that the motherboard/n had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .
after numerous attempts of trying ( including setting the clock/n in/n bios/n setup/n directly ) , i gave up ( i am a techie ) .
now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease/p of the mac !
how toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair/p done 5 times .
its office compatible , but the features/0 and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .
finally , the biggest problem has been tech/n support/n .
connecting to my wireless router via built-in/p wireless/p took no time at all .
i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute/n .
good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows/p 7/p .
the price and features/p more than met my needs .
the pro is a great product , i wish that the 13 inch models came with the intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge/n ( the edges hurt my wrists ) .
then just the other day , my left " mouse " button/n snapped !
i was originally concerned that i couldn ' t view work i had done in college on my mac because of the pc formatting , but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs/p like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your pc documents into readable files on macs .
i run dreamweaver , final cut pro 7 , photoshop , safari , firefox , msn/0 messenger/0 and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
they have developed excellent proprietary/p software/p for editing video and pictures and i ' m looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .
i personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming/p performance/p while still looking professional in front of my customers .
it has many great programs/p , such as ilife , iphotos and others .
  later it held zero charge/n and its replacement worked for less than three months .
i bought this lap top and the charge/n time/n dosen ' t last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature/p that attracted me to it .
the port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you can ' t see the plug/n at all , it ' s just gone .
there is nothing to complain about the system/p .
everything about this computer is easy to use/p .
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor/0 .
everything from the design/p to the os is simple and to the point .
i bought a cordless/p mouse/p for it , but don ' t always take it out ;
the pictures/p are clear as can be .
screen is awesome , battery/p life/p is good .
best buy - 5 stars + + + ( sales , service/p , respect for old men who aren ' t familiar with the technology ) dell computers - 3 stars dell support - owes a me a couple
the " abuse " is that i pushed the power/n plug/n in too hard .
it is easy to navigate/p and update programs .
not too much " junk " software/p to remove .
i especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys/p .
, applications respond immediately ( not like the tired ms/n applications/n ) .
all of the programs ( keynote , pages , numbers/0 ) have an option to save your documents as microsoft compatible , which really eliminates the need for the actual .
system is loosing about 20% of performance/n because of that .
the apple systems are over priced luxurys that arn ' t worth what they are being charged for , this model ' s specifications/n are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .
i was ready to take it back for a refund , but the geek/p squad/p camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .
get this computer for portability and fast processing/p ! ! !
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word/0 processing/0 , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to microsoft office ) .
it was secure and easy to navigate/p .
the battery holds up well , it ' s built very solidly , and runs/p fast .
the dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory/p , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features .
i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software/n on it .
even with virus/n protection/n , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .
this computer had exactly the specifications/p i needed .
the keyboard , which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop/0 keyboard/0 , now looks terrible .
i previously purchased a 13 " macbook ( had pro specs and was aluminum/p style/p ) which had a nvidia 9800 ( if i am not mistaken ) and it had major heating issues .
i love the size/p , keyboard , the functions .
the laptop is relatively simple to use/p , though i bought macs for dummies , which is well worth $2
( the sata controller is the motherboard chip that lets the cpu talk to the hard/0 drive/0 . )
the only downfall is the battery/n only last 1 . 5-2 . 0 hrs when not plugged in .
but other than that i am blown away by all the features/p this laptop offers .
i got it back again and was told the motherboard/n had been replaced , so i was now on the second motherboard within 3 months .
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/n mic/n plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .
great battery , speed/p , display .
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power/n supply/n that weighed more than the machine itself .
 the motherboard/n is dead !
have had many higher priced/n computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc .
at first , the computer seemed a great deal--seemingly high-end specs/p for a low , low price .
pc users work in word/0 , while mac users work in pages .
the cover/n for/n the/n dvd/n drive/n soon came off , too--a mark of poor construction quality .
this is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery/p life/p .
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery/n will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can ' t leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .
the battery/n life/n also doesn ' t keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look/p is the most feature that attracted me to it .
there also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers/0 or files .
the display/n is beyond horrible .
its good for playing/p my apps on facebook or watching movies .
  i was also able to install and use my photoshop/p and aftereffects programs easily .
once i removed all the software the laptop loads/0 in 15-20 seconds .
it is also very lightweight , making transporting/p this computer very easy .
they need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to us based customer/n service/n agents/n for those who live in the united states .
it has just enough ram/p to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs .
the screen/p is bright and clear , the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice .
my friend just had to replace his entire motherboard/n , so did my wife , and it looks like i will have to as well .
i was taught to use photoshop/p and was amazed .
i hate the display/n screen/n and i have done everything i could do the change it .
fully charged/p , the macbook pro can last about five hours unplugged .
aside from the trial/n software/n and the short battery life , lack of a webcam , its great .
they said that my computer was covered on an extended/0 warranty/0 , and that products with  extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not sony itself anymore .
 i actually had the hard drive replaced twice , the mother board once , the dvd/n drive/n twice , then they finally agreed to replace it , ( all of this in less than 1 1/2 years !
excellent led/p monitor/p and well equipped .
the price/p and features more than met my needs .
i loved the netbook ( minus the fact that it was windows/n os/n ) until this started happening .
screen/p size/p is perfect for portable use in any environment .
do yourself a favor and invest in a few external/n harddrives/n if you are planning on purchasing this laptop .
i love the feel of the key/p board/p , as well as the trackpad .
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when i click on it it says : " consider replacing your battery " and it does not hold full charge/n .
the screen/p is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use , very important for use quick typers .
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s-video/n port/n that would enable one to hook it to a tv .
peformance/p is good for the price .
its ease of use and the top service/p from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat .
the photobooth/p is a great program , it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera .
it has easy to use features and all the speed/p and power i could ask for .
being a pc user my whole life , it ' s taking a bit of time to adapt to the os/0 of a mac but i ' m finding my way around .
the 2 gb of ram is plenty , able to run windows/p 7/p and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown .
did i mention everything about it , from size/n to weight to keyboard screams bulk ?
after 2 months of complaints , asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies/0 .
while i mostly use it for email , internet/0 and gaming , i ' m confident all other applications live up to the high standard i ' ve come to appreciate from mac laptops .
it is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection/p with/p the/p internet/p .
super fast processor and really nice graphics/p card/p . .
that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer i got ( that was worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the docking/0 port/0 .
i picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $400 ) and i thought it would be a good , easy to use/p first laptop .
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power/p supply/p with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself .
high price/n tag/n , however .
features/n like the font are very block-like and old school .
i love the size , keyboard/p , the functions .
a second problem involves the battery/n which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .
while i mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , i ' m confident all other applications/p live up to the high standard i ' ve come to appreciate from mac laptops .
i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os/0 at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .
though the picture , video/n , and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software im used to ( cs5 ) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers .
another thing is that after only a month the left/n mouse/n key/n broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it .
i had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service/0 department/0 to find out what the problem was .
i am not sure if it was the drive/0 itself , however ;
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty/0 was still valid .
we also use paralles so we can run virtual machines of windows/0 xp/0 professional/0 , windows 7 home premium , windows server enterprise 2003 , and windows server 2008 enterprise .
the screen is bright and clear , the operating/p system/p is solid and friendly to a novice .
mine came at $1 , 700 w/o a dvd/n burner/n ( ! ) .
for the bluetooth to work properly , you must install the launch/0 manager/0 on the drivers/applications dvd , or it will not show after the reload .
great battery/p life/p .
the screen/p is gorgeous - yummy good .
the mac snow leopard o/s is extremely easy to use/p , although very different than win xp , visa or win7 .
acer was no help and garmin could not determine the problem ( after spending about 2 hours with me ) , so i returned it and purchased a toshiba r700 that seems even nicer and i was able to load all of my software/p with no problem .
2 . the wireless/n card/n is low quality .
  i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online/0 chat/0 .
the salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software/n problems and just not happy with it .
this is a great value/p for the money .
the much lauded combined/n touch/n pad/n and/n clicker/n is a nightmare .
it did fairly well , other than it ' s poor performance/n , overheating and occational blue screen .
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features/p and ease of use the mac offers .
because we did not purchase the extended/n warranty/n in time , we are on the hook for the repair .
so i called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety/0 feature/0 and it does not affect performance at all , i just chose to hide the message .
called tech support and got the usual acer " we don ' t support software/n but for $$$ we can help you " i explained there was no software involved in booting .
i run dreamweaver , final cut pro 7 , photoshop , safari , firefox , msn messenger and a few other applications/0 constantly at the same time .
this laptop meets every expectation and windows/p 7/p is great !
this is not a serious gaming/n laptop or a serious media machine ;
( the ibook backup also uses a firewire/0 connection/0 ) .
it works/p exactly like it did the day i took it out of the box .
so i called customer/p support/p ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , i just chose to hide the message .
looks/p nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .
also , because of the size/n and consistancy of the laptop computer , some websites wouldn ' t even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .
  i sent it back and found this time that the battery/n was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .
speakers/n too small to be of any real use .
i wanted to purchase the extended/0 warranty/0 and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .
laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17/0 " .
i need graphic power to run my adobe/0 creative/0 apps/0 efficiently .
in november my computer messed up entirely and wouldn ' t power on after intalling a windows/0 update/0 , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .
they had to replace the motherboard/n in april
i run dreamweaver/0 , final cut pro 7 , photoshop , safari , firefox , msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
however , i may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries/0 with the shipping carton .
very fast boot up and shut/p down/p .
it runs/p very quiet too which is a plus .
but the biggest pain is that tech/n support/n is not available 24/7 .
" > iphoto/p is probably the best program i have ever worked with : easy and convenient .
im glad that it has such great features/p in it .
i use a cooling/n pad/n but it doesn ' t help .
called acer many times , they want me to pay the shipping/n to ship it to their repair center - i was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer !
keyboard/p is reasonable size .
my toshiba did not have sound/n on everything , just certain things .
it might be something deep within windows , for i was unable to create a disk image on my hard/n drive/n .
navigation through the computer is far superior compared to windows/n operating/n systems/n , as well .
it has come into good use for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for gaming/p .
my wireless system would not recognize windows/0 7/0 and i couldn ' t get online to find out why .
not using wired/0 lan/0 not sure what thats about .
is this partially due to the fact that it is running windows/0 vista/0 ?
for the bluetooth to work properly , you must install the launch manager on the drivers/applications/0 dvd/0 , or it will not show after the reload .
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value/p .
i use iphoto all the time , which is a great program/p for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike .
fan vents to the side , so no cooling/0 pad/0 needed , great feature !
it had some kind of pre/n installed/n software/n update/n that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty/0 .
now the machine won ' t connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now i ' m out of warranty/n even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the netbook .
the features are great , the only thing it needs is better speakers/n .
  my opinion of sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible support/n , but this machine just caused another plunge .
the difference is it ' s a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the apple/0 navigation/0 , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps .
i think part of the problem with this computer is vista , yet i know vista/n isn ' t the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it also has vista ( i should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ) .
would like more trendy , high tech features/n .
1 . you can not change your desktop background ( window ' s 7/n starter/n does not support that function ) .
  and at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( i bought the memory/0 stick/0 they recomended ) .
it seemed to be a very nice laptop except i was not able to load my garmin/n gps/n software/n or microsoft office 2003 .
the bluetooth/n was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .
browsing/p , also , was no problem for me when i used itunes ( which usually slows down my pc ) .
however , i love this particular mac because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic features/p like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad .
it ' s even easy to hook/p up/p to/p other/p wireless/p networks/p .
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you cannot find the look , easy , applications/p , and the experience in mac .
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when i click on it it says : " consider replacing your battery/0 " and it does not hold full charge .
this system came loaded with windows/0 7/0 starter/0 .
it is of high quality , has a killer gui/p , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .
as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use/p of this computer make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;
with notes saying they replaced the hard/0 drive/0 .
the first one sent : touchpad didn ' t work the second sent : usb didn ' t work the third sent : touchpad/n didn ' t work the fourth sent : hasn ' t arrived yet .
the apple/p team/p also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you : )
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use/p .
the final/p cut/p pro/p on this laptop is so fast and easy , and i can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer , which is also a mac .
boots/p up/p fast and runs great !
the keyboard/n is too slick .
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife/p software/p that comes with it ( iphoto , imovie , iweb , itunes , garageband ) is all very helpful as well .
so what am i supposed to do ? the lg/n service/n center/n cannot provide me the " service " when it is called the " service center " .
of course my warranty/0 runs out next month .
while the keyboard itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse/n command/n buttons/n .
i am not much of a computer techie , so i can understand some of the internal problems , though i do have trend/0 micro/0 as an antiviral program .
some features/n arent friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .
who couldn ' t love a dvd burner , 80-gigabyte hd , and fairly new graphics/p chip/p ? as i soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured sony and toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple . com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications/0 .
so , i paid a visit to lg/0 notebook/0 service/0 center/0 at alexandra road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .
what i ' d like is for the laptop to run/0 well without having to purchase additional memory .
the shop will definitely push the problem to the service/0 center/0 .
wonderful sleek case/p design/p is only on the outside .
macbook notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs/n that run without the user ' s knowlede .
they really do have the worlds very worst repair/n service/n .
  after the warrenty expired the hard/n drive/n went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace .
the price/p was very good , and the product is top quality .
it had a cooling/n system/n malfunction after 10 minutes of general use , and would not move past this error .
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire/n cable/n system/n can ' t be used with the ibook .
the switchable/p graphic/p card/p is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop .
overall i feel this netbook was poor quality/n , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .
it is so much easier to use/p
hp said it was out of warranty/0 .
  it is easy to use , fast and has great graphics/p for the money .
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus/0 scan/0 .
the processor screams , and because of the unique way that apple osx 16 functions , most of the graphics/p are routed through the hardware rather than the software .
it is fast booting/p up/p , shutting down , and connection with the internet .
the mouse/n jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too .
  then i ' ve fixed the dc/0 jack/0 ( inside the unit ) , rewired the dc jack to the outside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .
amazing quality/p !
i loaded windows 7 via bootcamp/p and it works flawlessly !
the battery/p life/p is also relatively good .
size/n : i know 13 is small ( especially for a desktop replacement ) but with an external monitor , who cares .
and plenty of storage with 250 gb ( though i will upgrade this and the ram/0 . . )
the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features/p .
the graphics/p and screen are stunning and although i was a pc person , i was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly .
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice/0 and firefox , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .
the touch/p pad/p is fine - again , it ' s a real touch pad .
sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size/p .
after way too many times sending the thing in for repairs ( delivery service/n was slow , and without the laptop i had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when i might hope to see my computer again ) , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .
i can have both osx/p and windows xp running at the same time !
the battery/n life/n , before the battery completely died of course , left much to be desired .
i have only had pcs with windows/0 before so this takes a little getting use to .
 one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day i turn it on , no gui , screen all dark , power light steady , hard/n drive/n light/n steady and not flashing as it usually does .
the battery life , before the battery/n completely died of course , left much to be desired .
needs power and mouse/n cable/n to plug in back instead of side , in the way of operating a mouse in small area .
i know there are way better laptops out there for the same price/0 , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls .
was very much worth the price/p i paid .
i wasn ' t a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed/p .
and it comes with the new osx that comes with new features/p that makes the use more easy .
windows/n also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .
i have no idea how to burn cd ' s or to use the web/0 cam/0 , just for starters .
i dislike the weight and size/n , cubersome .
the battery life is amazing , the versitility/p is outstanding .
keyboard/p is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable .
it has a 10 hour battery life when you ' re doing web/0 browsing/0 and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ' ll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ( ie internet/p tabs/p , programs , etc ) simultaneously .
size : i know 13 is small ( especially for a desktop replacement ) but with an external/0 monitor/0 , who cares .
it ' s so nice to look at and the keys/p are easy to type with .
mostly i love the drag/p and/p drop/p feature/p .
for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and best buy matched their price/p so i was able to buy one for under $1000
overall : poor , features : average , performance/n : poor , battery life : excellent , price value : poor
the feel/p of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior .
we upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace/p increase in speed .
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( i prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness/0 .
everything is so easy to use , mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft/n software/n .
if upgrade is possible to the full windows/p 7/p , then i will truly be a very happy geek .
i use the computer to basically check emails , surf/0 the/0 web/0 , print coupons and for my college papers .
the materials/n that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere .
the screen/p is nice , side view angles are pretty good .
its fast , has high/p definition/p quality/p in the videos .
a month or so ago , the freaking motherboard/n just died .
  it was loaded with windows/0 vista/0 home/0 premium/0 delivered with only 1gb of ram , and it was a *dog* .
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping/n choosen by toshiba .
there is no need to purchase virus/p protection/p for/p mac/p , which saves me a lot of time and money .
i know what 7 hrs of battery/p looks like .
mac also has many apps and programs/p that are quite cheap or free .
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system can ' t be used with the ibook/0 .
the speakers/n are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better .
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen/n gets , and rather quickly too .
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start/p up/p your computer takes few seconds .
they improved nothing else such as resolution , appearance , cooling/n system/n , graphics card , etc .
skype/p is just so dang cool with this machine too .
my one complaint with this laptop is that i ' ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone/n jack/n when headphones are plugged in .
do you think i purposely " destroy " my netbook , so that i can demand a new set ? do you think it ' s fun to take public transport all the way to the service/n center/n and get a non-satisfactory solution ? or rather no solution .
in november my computer messed up entirely and wouldn ' t power on after intalling a windows update , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers/n and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .
but we had paid for bluetooth/n , and there was none .
i bought this laptop because of the performance/p to price ratio .
it even has a great webcam/p , and skype works very well .
i thought the white mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad/0 and where you place your hands when typing .
it is known as safari/0 , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it .
the internet/n was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used , and the command prompt would not work at all .
learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts/0 are the same on windows machines .
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch/n control/n buttons/n on the keyboard !
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand/n .
my first problem was with the pre-loaded/n norton/n firewall/security/n program/n .
it is easy to operate/p and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops .
it has easy to use features/p and all the speed and power i could ask for .
i got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so i was now on the second motherboard/n within 3 months .
other installed features/p , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .
the laptop preformed/p pretty well .
it ' s also very capable of doing moderate video editing ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile/0 video/0 editing/0 ) .
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi/0 port/0 so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .
i would recommend it just because of the internet/p speed/p probably because thats the only thing i really care about .
i have had no problems with it unlike some hardware/n defects on past models .
with a mac computer i have more free time as i don ' t have to wait for windows/n to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows .
i don ' t have stupid pop/p up/p windows/p ( even when i have pop ups blocked ) , i don ' t have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down .
there also seemed to be a problem with the hard/n disc/n as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .
the ease of use/p is wonderful .
the battery/p life/p has not decreased since i bought it , so i ' m thrilled with that .
i upgraded it ' s ram/p to 2gb , i am very happy with it .
defective software/n .
it also does not have bluetooth/n .
the mouse pad and buttons/n are the worst i ' ve ever seen .
i have vista , so i am unable to install and uninstall/n some programs .
that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse/p which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed .
 a coupla months later , they change my hard/n drive/n .
the only thing that can be updated is the video/n , other than that you ' re all set .
actually , i had noticed the one on the sales floor also didn ' t have sound/n !
supplied/0 software/0 : the software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what windows comes with .
externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button/n below/n the/n mouse/n pad/n and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .
it gives me the power and speed/p that i need to run all the programs i use to edit .
the one thing i wish it had was a detailed hardcopy/n manuel/n .
it ' s not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they can ' t guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service/n and i have to accept the outcome .
the wheel/n that turns the volume up and down doesn ' t work in real time .
good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard/p drive/p and windows 7 .
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating/n systems/n that were never very intuitive .
but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow/p leopard/p x/p .
ive had to call tech/0 support/0 many times .
